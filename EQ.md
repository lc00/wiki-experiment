* Subsonic energy eats up your dynamic range and masks bass, filter it out
* EQ combined with panning makes a space for each instrument
* Wide Q is good for emphasis and making space, narrow Q is good for removing problem frequencies
* Good EQ reduces the need for compression
* Use EQ to shape reverb and delay
* Cutting low end makes something sound brighter
* EQ in context of the mix

## EQ Stages

* Track EQ for removing problems and making space (+/- 15dB)
* Bus EQ for balancing instrument groups (+/- 10dB)
* Master EQ for removing mud (+/- 6dB)
 
## Notching

* Narrow boost to find a problem frequency
* Cut it
* Disengage the EQ to make sure it's gone

## Bass vs. Kick

* Kick is usually around 60Hz
* You want the bass to sit a little higher
* HPF the bass, but use a low shelf to put a "bump" in front of it
* Bass is usually 110Hz-140Hz
