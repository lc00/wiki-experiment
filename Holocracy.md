## Goals

1. Designing roles that match individual capability with organizational goals
2. Making decisions closer to the work
3. Responding to emerging market needs

## Implementation

* Lead link - Responsible for assigning people to roles in circles

Employees carve parts of their job they don't want into new roles, which lead links can assign people to

* There is still organizational structure, it's actually very nested
* There's still hierarchy, it's just contextual
* It's not majority rule- changes are adopted unless someone else proposes that they are harmful

## Issues

* Splits attention in a lot of different directions (an average of 3 responsibilities per each of the 7 roles someone has on average)
* Complicates compensation
* Complicates hiring
* While differences in status are mitigated, they definitely still exist
* When leadership is a shared responsibility, everyone must practice it
