* Early reflections define the shape of the room
* Reverb tail is what makes it sound "other worldly"
* Helps instruments gel and sound like they were recorded in the same room
* Adds depth, pushes something back in the mix
* Predelay can make something sound close and reverberant
    * A little goes a long way (30ms-80ms)
* You can combine reverbs
    * Try short plate and long hall
* You can add a chorus before the reverb to thicken reverb
* Reverb often needs to have lows and mids dumped out of it
