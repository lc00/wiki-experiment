* Doing a lot of things at once makes it impossible to strengthen the neutral pathway because so many things are firing at once
* When switching tasks, you get left with "attention residue", diluting your focus. Checking messages really quickly is a way of starting tasks that you can't finish, leaving that residue on your focus.
* Busyness as a proxy for productivity- in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive, people reach for industrial tools, like being visibly busy
* The first step to changing the world is changing how you see it
* It's harder to enjoy free time than work because it's naturally unstructured and there are no clear goals. Deep work generates flow states
* Your engineering may become archaic, but your craftsmanship can still be honored eternally
* Great creative minds think like artists, but work like accountants
* Deep work styles: monastic (no external distractions), bimodal (seasonal focus, minimum one day), rhythmic (same time of day), journalistic (when schedule allows, minimum one hour)
    * Regardless, use the same place every time, make rules to reduce willpower drains, and know what supporting things you need
* "Grand gestures", like exotic locations, reduce your mind's desire to procrastinate
* In 4DX terms, your lead measure is hours spent in deep work toward your WIG
* Don't carry context between days- when you're done, be done
* You can only spend between one and four hours a day in deliberate practice
* Have a shutdown ritual for work
* Once you wire yourself for constant distraction, you start craving it
* Schedule blocks of time to use the internet, and avoid it otherwise
* While doing something physical like walking, focus on a singular problem (productive meditation)
* Be on guard for "looping"
* Concentration is more important than memory for remembering things
* It's not whether there's some benefit to be gained from social media, it's the opportunity cost of it
* Approach the networked tools you use as a time investment
* Most coffees, reviews, etc. are shallow work
