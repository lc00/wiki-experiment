## Student-Centered Learning

* Personalized Learning: Customizing for each student
* Competency-based Learning: Students must demonstrate mastery of a subject: possession/application/creation of knowledge/skill/disposition before moving on

## Understanding

### What Is Blended Learning?

* Disruptive innovation starts with non-consumers, and as it matures it attacks more competitive markets
* "Blended" != "Technology-Rich"

1. In part through online learning
    * Formal education program where the student learns at least in part through online learning, with some student control of pace, place, and/or path
2. In part in a Supervised Brick-and-Mortar Location
    * Away from home with some teacher or guide supervision
3. An integrated learning experience
    * The two parts coordinate together

#### Blended Models

##### Rotation

* Rotate through different modalities, at least one of which is online
* Online, small-group, pencil/paper assignments
* The clock or the teacher rotates everyone
* Station rotation: Everyone does this in a classroom or set of classrooms
* Lab rotation: Online stuff is done in a computer lab to free up space and use a different staffing model
* Flipped classroom: Lessons and lectures are consumed independently, homework is done in class with teacher help
* What's the best use of the classroom time?
* Individual rotation: Each student's rotation is personalized

##### Flex

* Started with renting shopping mall spaces for credit recovery
* Online is the backbone of the learning experience, teacher is on-site, student moves through based on their own needs

##### A La Carte

* Entire course is taken online at an otherwise brick-and-mortar program
* Teacher of record is the online teacher

##### Enriched Virtual Model

* Occasional, regular in-person meetings
* Face-to-face is required, but much of the work is done online
* CU Boulder CAETE

### Are All Classrooms Going To Blend?

* Hybrid innovations combine the old with the new. They help incumbents stay in power a little longer ("sustaining innovation"), but makes them ripe for disruption by true innovation.
* Disruptive innovations start with non-consumers, not the high end
* Like banks, online education is unlikely to wipe out traditional education because in-person offers some things that are hard to replicate online
* Station & lab rotation and flipped classrooms are sustaining innovations
* Flex, a-la-carte, enriched virtual, and individual rotation are disruptive

#### Hybrids

1. Hybrid innovations include both the old and new technology
2. Hybrid innovations target existing customers rather than nonconsumers
3. Customers want hybrids to outperform the existing system according to the old rules of the game
    * Disruptive technologies thrive in environments that value them for what they are
4. Hybrid innovations tend to be more complicated to operate than disruptive innovations
    * Because the require expertise in both

If you can't figure out where the front of the classroom is, you're probably in a disruptive model.

Online learning with a physical component, instead of a physical classroom with an online component.

## Mobilizing

* You need a well-defined problem statement that doesn't reference the technology, "21st century skills," etc.
* To transform an organization, you can create a "school within a school."

## Designing

### Motivate the Students

What do students want?

* Students want to feel successful
* They want to have fun with their friends

Components of a job-to-be-done:

1. What is the actual thing that needs to be accomplished?
2. What experience will seamlessly deliver that thing?
3. What and how will you integrate to deliver that experience?

What students need:

* **Agency**. They need to be empowered to set their own goals.
* **Individual Mastery**. Allowing students to master content before moving on.
* **Access to actionable data and rapid feedback**. This also allows them to more effectively collaborate with each other.
* **Transparency in learning goals**. Both the subject and the time frame.
* **Sustained periods of quiet, solitary reading time**.
* **Meaningful work experiences**. The work needs to feel relevant for them to engage.
* **Mentorship**. Helps coach students through tough times and teaches them to build social capital.
* **Positive group experiences**.

Summit: Assesments available on demand, learning content available via "playlists." Students meet with mentors once a week, have regular long-term projects, and opportunitities to learn out in the world.

### Elevate Teaching

* Teacher roles shift to become powerful mentors or guides
* Advisory groups

Different teacher roles:

* Content experts who develop curriculum
* Small group leaders who teach in station rotation
* Project designers who come up with hands on applications
* Mentors who provide wisdom, social capital, and guidance
* Evaluators who can grade
* Data experts

### Design the Virtual and Physical Setup

* Designs eventually go from integrated to modular as modular's performance reaches critical mass. School is currently integrated, and needs to become modular.
* Where on the spectrum between going fully DIY and fully outsourced will you land? What resources do you have?
* Use furniture on wheels
* "Studios" instead of classroom

### Choose The Model

1. What problem are you trying to solve? (core or non-consumption)
2. What type of team do you need to solve this problem (functional, light, heavy, or autonomous)
3. What do you want students to control? (Path, pace, place)
4. What do you wan the primary role of the teacher to be? (Lecturer, guide, online)
5. What physical space can you use?
6. How many internet connected devices are available?

## Implementing

* Blending accelerates good or bad cultures because of the degree of student autonomy.
* Learn and pivot as you go
