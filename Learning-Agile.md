## Learning Agile

* Do you understand the principles first, or adopt the practices and hope an understanding of the principles will develop?

## Understanding Agile Values

Agile is a set of methods and methodologies that your team think more effectively, work more efficiently, and make better decisions. It's the ability to handle change. It involves project management + software design and architecture + process improvement, and it's also a mindset.

### The Stand-up Mindset

Where stand-ups go wrong:

* The PM is worried about people deviating from their plan, so they focus on getting everyone's status. They get mad that they only find out about problems when it's too late to do anything about it.
* Devs don't want to go to another meeting. They tune and say as little as possible so they can get back to work

If the project was collectively planned, the PM doesn't have to worry about deviations from _their_ plan, and might better understand that the plan everyone came up with together might need to change. The standup becomes a chance for everyone to learn something from each other and come up with better plans.

## The Agile Principles

The Waterfall Process:

* Requirements
* Design
* Implementation
* Verification
* Maintenance

Described by Winston Royce from Lockheed in 1970 in response to a "software engineering crisis" resulting from common problems. "Planning the work and then working the plan" causes problems through overly rigid documentation, poor communication, and bugs. Project managers get held accountable for out-of-date plans. The best waterfall teams usually have in common:

* Consistent communication between users, managers, and executives throughout the project
* Good practices (code reviews, automated testing, defect prevention)
* Drawers full of documentation that had never been opened (the thought that went into them was the important part

These are also common the best agile teams.

### Initial challenges with going agile

Better than-not-doing-it results:

* Devs make technical sacrifices to keep the schedule
* PMs feel blind because they can't see ahead on the roadmap, reacting rather than planning, coordinating rather than controlling, collecting statuses and relaying them to stakeholders
* Account managers feel like they have to be a full-time part of the team, answer a lot of questions, and go to a lot of meetings

This is the result of fractured perspectives on many agile practices. Each stakeholder views the purpose of a practice  slightly differently. User stories aren't just Gantt charts on a whiteboard, and everyone's roles change a little. Some people are giving up control that they are accustomed to, others are taking ownership they didn't have before. If everyone only focuses on their tasks, the team as a whole is at a disadvantage.

Largest sources of failure with agile projects (VerionOne State of Agile survey):

* Lack of experience using agile methods
* Company philosophy at odds with agile values
* External pressure to follow waterfall practices
