## Learning Agile

* Do you understand the principles first, or adopt the practices and hope an understanding of the principles will develop?

### The Stand-up Mindset

Where stand-ups go wrong:

* The PM is worried about people deviating from their plan, so they focus on getting everyone's status. They get mad that they only find out about problems when it's too late to do anything about it.
* Devs don't want to go to another meeting. They tune and say as little as possible so they can get back to work

If the project was collectively planned, the PM doesn't have to worry about deviations from _their_ plan, and might better understand that the plan everyone came up with together might need to change. The standup becomes a chance for everyone to learn something from each other and come up with better plans.

## Understanding Agile Values

Agile is a set of methods and methodologies that your team think more effectively, work more efficiently, and make better decisions. It's the ability to handle change. It involves project management + software design and architecture + process improvement, and it's also a mindset.

The Waterfall Process:

* Requirements
* Design
* Implementation
* Verification
* Maintenance

Described by Winston Royce from Lockheed in 1970 in response to a "software engineering crisis" resulting from common problems. "Planning the work and then working the plan" causes problems through overly rigid documentation, poor communication, and bugs. Project managers get held accountable for out-of-date plans. The best waterfall teams usually have in common:

* Consistent communication between users, managers, and executives throughout the project
* Good practices (code reviews, automated testing, defect prevention)
* Drawers full of documentation that had never been opened (the thought that went into them was the important part

These are also common the best agile teams.

### Initial challenges with going agile

Better than-not-doing-it results:

* Devs make technical sacrifices to keep the schedule
* PMs feel blind because they can't see ahead on the roadmap, reacting rather than planning, coordinating rather than controlling, collecting statuses and relaying them to stakeholders
* Account managers feel like they have to be a full-time part of the team, answer a lot of questions, and go to a lot of meetings

This is the result of fractured perspectives on many agile practices. Each stakeholder views the purpose of a practice  slightly differently. User stories aren't just Gantt charts on a whiteboard, and everyone's roles change a little. Some people are giving up control that they are accustomed to, others are taking ownership they didn't have before. If everyone only focuses on their tasks, the team as a whole is at a disadvantage. The agile elephant is bigger than the sum of all of its individual practices.

Largest sources of failure with agile projects (VerionOne State of Agile survey):

* Lack of experience using agile methods
* Company philosophy at odds with agile values
* External pressure to follow waterfall practices

### The Agile Manifesto

* **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**: People can go wrong blindly following a process, and the wrong tool just helps them do the wrong thing faster. This is supported by standups, retros, and user stories.
* **Working software over comprehensive documentation**: Use documentation that actually helps people make the software, and actually making the software is a good way to make sure that things are on track. Documentation can be good without being comprehensive. This is supported by TDD. Comprehensive documentation is always biased by the author's perspective, and ends up with a fractured perspective.
* **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**: No SLAs, no finger-pointing. Embed a customer representative on the team.
* **Responding to change over following a plan**: If you work the wrong plan, you'll build the wrong product. It takes work to change a plan, so people resist it. This is supported by task boards.

> Without concrete practices, principles are sterile; but without principles, practices have no life, no character, no heart. Great products arise from great teams--Teams who are principled, who have character, who have heart, who have persistence, and who have courage.
- Jim Highsmith

### Methodologies

**Scrum**:

* Make a prioritized list of features (product backlog)
* Each month, pull off the top of the list (about one month's worth), and promise to deliver in a month
* Every day, meet for 5-10 minutes
* Make one person the scrum master, and make it their job to remove roadblocks

**XP**: Produce deployable software every week. In each iteration, the team analyzes, designs, codes, tests, and deploys a subset of features.

Scrum and XP are both timeboxed and iterative. Timeboxing helps users know when they can expect new features to be delivered.

**Lean**: Mindset (not a methodology) about reducing waste.

**Kanban**: Method for improving process, built on lean.

## The Agile Principles

Give customers what they need, not what they ask for. Over the course of a long project, there's a high likelihood of the external environment changing and obviating some of your plans. If an ebook reader takes a year and a half to develop, there's a good chance the reader the market needs in a year and a half isn't what you would have come up with at the beginning.

* **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software**: Releasing software early, delivering value continuously, and satisfying the customer are 3 different things that work together. Dealing with customer panic over early versions of software can be dealt with by emphasizing collaboration and flexibility, and by building trust through the continuous delivery.
* **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage**. Why are changes to projects so emotionally charged? Until the change, you thought you were doing a good job, and when a customer changes their mind it feels like they're disrespecting your work. But customers didn't intentionally send you down the wrong path. It might even be embarassing for them to admit that. Your deadline might be blown, but so is theirs. You're being asked to read the customer's mind, they're being expected to predict the future. Don't blame, no one's in trouble when something changes, don't sit on changes, don't view changes as mistakes, and use everything to learn.
* **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale**: Agile deals with the chaos of changing requirements by working iteratively and delivering frequently. The frequent deadlines allow the team to stay on track and get lots of feedback early.

## The Agile Coach

* Talk to team members separately and try to understand how their perspectives differ across the different roles.
  * Ask them what they think about each of the values and principles
* Find the agile practices the team thinks feel "empty" and are giving them better-than-not-doing-it results
* Look for values or principles they're already tacitly aligned on
