## The Stretch Goal Paradox

[Original article](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-stretch-goal-paradox)

The organization that would benefit the most from stretch goals rarely do them, and the organizations for whom stretch goals are a poor fit often turn to them to generate breakthroughs.

A stretch goal has extreme difficulty and extreme novelty. For a company to be ready for a stretch goal, it should have recently achieved a success. Take bold, risky action when you're strong rather than weak. It should also have slack resources, which helps cushion losses and maximize experimentation. Stretch goals are great for organizations that are thriving, but complacent. If you're not ready for stretch goals, you might be better off pursuing small wins, small losses, or intentionally developing slack resources.

## Kick-Ass Customer Service

[Original article](https://hbr.org/2017/01/kick-ass-customer-service)

* 81% of customers across industries prefer self-service to talking to a person
* Live customer service costs $7 an interaction for a B2C company and $13 for a B2B company
* Today, customer service reps get increasingly hard cases that customers can't solve themselves, but they face poor training and high churn, all of which affects customer satisfaction and increases recruiting costs
* "Controllers" who take charge of the customer's situation widely outperform "Empathizers" who try to understand where the customer is coming from, despite being the type managers least want to hire
* 84% of customers just want a straightforward solution to their problem instead of an array of choices
* Invest in improving self-service tools
* Preempt repeat calls by anticipating what the next call might be and solving that too
* If an 8 hour window is unpalatable, try offering a 2 hour window in 3 days (it makes the immediate 8 hour window seem better)
* Job postings should focus less on looking for rule-following factory drones, and more on attracting knowledge workers who want to flex their expertise and have a personality. Deemphasize prior experience and play up the challenge.

| Activity              | What most reps do       | What controllers do |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Engaging the customer | Treat each customer in a consistent way, following a script: "First, I'd like to thank you for being a loyal customer. Now how can I help you today? | Customize the interaction to individual customer personalities and contexts. |
| Troubleshooting       | Stick to prescribed checklists and steps: "First, we'll need to install the latest version of the software." | Identify what customers have already done on their own and skip ahead to the right next step for them: "Ok, if you've followed all the troubleshooting advice on the webiste, then you've obviously already installed the latest version of the software. Let's try something else." |
| Presenting solutions  | Give customers a choice of resolution options: "You can mail your device back to us at this address, or you can bring it to one of our stores for a replacement." | Prescribe the fastest and easiest resolution path: "I don't see your device in stock at your local store. I'd recommend mailing us your old one-- you'll get a replacement a lot faster." |
| Resolving issues      | Solve only the problem the customer called about: "Have I fully resolved your issue today?" | Anticipate and resolve additional potential problems: "Customers in your situation often end up facing a related issue. Let me tell you about that now so you won't have to call back later." |
