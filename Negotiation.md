## Final-offer Arbitration

[Original article](https://hbr.org/2016/09/how-to-make-the-other-side-play-fair)

Encourages the other party to be more reasonable.

If these 4 criteria are met:

1. You have made a reasonable offer that has been countered with an unreasonable one
2. You are confident of what a fair resolution would be
3. Escalating the dispute into litigation would be costly
4. Neither side can easily walk away

You can choose an arbiter to pick whichever offer is more reasonable, but may not split the difference.

* People have a harder time negating a true statement than affirming a false one
* Look out for dodges by writing your question down, and writing their answer next to it
* Don't overstate your confidentiality, it makes people clam up
* Introduce contingency clauses to the negotiation based on the veracity of what you've been told
