## Typography

* Knowing typographic classifications can help you make more informed decisions about usage
  * Transitional typefaces are from the mid 18th century (like Baskerville), are refined versions of 15th century typefaces, which means they are more elegant and easier to read
  * Display type is heavier weights of standard typefaces that are more suitable for large sizes
  * Decorative/novelty faces are unsuitable for body copy
  * Categories:
    * Old Style
    * Transitional
    * Neoclassical
    * Glyphic
    * Slab
    * Grotesque
    * Geometric
    * Square
    * Formal
    * Casual
    * Calligraphic
    * Blackletter
    * Antique
    * Novelty
* "Grunge" typefaces from the 90s sacrificed readability and legibility for style, which is appropriate for some audiences
* Don't use system fonts for print design
* You can mix typefaces to create typographic texture, but not hierarchy.
  * Look for historical links between typefaces
  * Try combinations where the features of each underpins their role in your layout
    * eg. Early grotesque for headlines with a transitional serif for text
  * Look for harmonious relationships between elements, like heights and widths
  * Look for shared characteristics, like elegant stems and bowls, consistent stroke thickness, etc.
  * Don't mix serif fonts
* Pick a body font, and then for the headline change only 1: size, color, weight, or case.
* Don't use ultra-thin typefaces for logo design (they shrink poorly)
* You need to manually kern script fonts
* Use real handwriting for handwritten text
* Don't fake a bold or italic font
* A serif's italic font needs to be slightly larger
* Use old-style figures (also called "expert figures") for numbers and dates in copy. They have ascenders and descenders, unlike "aligning figures", which are usually the default numbers and look "all capital" and should be used with all-caps.
* Using more than a point of stroke on a letterform starts hurting the integrity of it
* You can't do reversed text small, and you can't read lots of it
* Capitals in long body copy hurt readability since the letters have less variation, and thus take longer to recognize
* The first few words after a drop cap should be small caps
* Hang lines of text from a tab in a bulleted list
* Small x-height on letters makes their ascenders and descenders more pronounced, large x-heights make the letters look more solid and weighty and usually require more leading
* Lots of leading makes something feel light and airy, not very much makes it feel tense. 120% is a good baseline.
* Manually kern unsightly letter combos (eg. Kn, To, Ve, and Wi) and headlines (especially A, K, T, V, and W)
* Average 45-75 characters per line, no more than 80
* The second line of a paragraph should be longer than the first
* Don't end the second line with a dangling "it", "is", or "a"
* The penultimate line of a paragraph should be longer than the last
* Don't hyphenate words of fewer than 7 characters, and don't hyphenate ragged-right text
* Don't justify short text
* Don't mix centered text, left, and right justified text
* Avoid widows (single words or lines at the start of a page) and orphans (single words at the end of a page)
* Use correctly formatted fractions in text
* Use en-dashes for ranges, em-dashes for conversational breaks
* Hang quotation marks outside of paragraph margins
* Add a period to an ellipsis that ends a sentence.
