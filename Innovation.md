* Incumbent's internal systems (metrics, resource allocation, incentives, recruitment, investment, and promotion) are always set up to support the old model. Even if an incumbent can overcome their internal challenges, can their supply chain keep up?
* New innovations require tight control over the value chain and partners who can adapt with you. Mature products can modularize and operate in isolation.
* Modern models depend on understanding every customer's life and offering a custom experience. You don't need big data, you need small data to personalize the experience.
* IT used to help enterprises become more efficient. Now, it helps newcomers scale up and have closer relationships with customers.
* Data is:
    * Scalable - Moreso than physical production
    * Defensible - Hard for a competitor to replicate
    * Reinforcable - Better over time for free
* Output-based metrics favor traditional execution. Measure things that favor long-term strategy.

Spontaneous private deregulation = Platforms ignoring laws (eg. Uber, AirBnb). Incumbents are at risk if:
* The consumers are unnecessarily being protected
* Your business practices can be codified or computer assisted
