## Notes

* Standards are meaningless without assessments
* Use data to inform instruction

## Techniques

### No Opt-Out

* You provide the answer, student repeats
* Another student provides the answer, student repeats
* You provide a cue, student uses it to provide the answer
* Another student provides a cue, student uses it to provide the answer

### Right Is Right

* “almost right” is not good enough. Don’t “round up” an answer.
