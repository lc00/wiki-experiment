## Notes

* Standards are meaningless without assessments
* Use data to inform instruction
* Time is your most precious commodity

## Check For Understanding

### Gathering Data on Student Mastery

* You can get data through questioning or observation.

#### Reject Self-Report

* Replace rhetorical questions with more objective forms of assessment
* No "Got it?"
* They might feel like they were the only ones who didn't get it and are holding back the group
* Not _self-monitoring_:
    * Take a thoughtful assessment of themselves
    * Figure out precisely what they don't know
    * Take action to fix it

#### Targeted Questioning

* Ask multiple, quick, open-ended questions to a strategic sample of the class to get data on where they are
* Self-monitoring is expensive, targeted questioning is cheap
* Needs to be fast - 1-2 minutes
* Ask 5-6 questions to a sample of the class- cold call them
* Have the questions in advance
* The answers you get are a data set - NOT a story that culminates in the right answer

#### Standardize the Format

* Make observation easier by making it easier to find the data you're looking for
* Same tool, same place, same format- aids in gathering data quickly
* Similar physical layouts that are easier to scan
* Find out if people need more time
* Find out which options people chose
* Find out what common mistakes you could talk about during the debrief

#### Tracking, Not Watching

* Decide what you're looking for when you're scanning the classroom
* Separate _excellence_ from _completion_. Track specific errors and success points.
* Keep track of amount of error and success points, use them as data
* Track specific students to call on

#### Show Me

* Make sure students actively show you evidence of their understanding
* Hand signals (giving your their answer with a number, or a sign)
* Slates to show you their work
* Clickers for answers to multiple choice questions
* Objective data shown to the teacher in unison

#### Affirmative Checking

* Make students verify that they understand something before they move on
* Need to be able to verify that they're at the checkpoint very quickly
* Students aren't waiting for everyone else to catch up
* Students give you a signal that they're ready to be checked
* Students can do peer checking too

### Acting on the Data and the Culture of Error

* Once you have data, you need to do something with it

#### Plan for Error

* Give yourself eyes for errors by planning for common mistakes in advance
* By knowing specific mistakes in advance, you may even be able to prevent them from happening
* Have multiple paths through your lesson based on the performance
* Have more material than you need, so you can jump back, ahead, or continue on
* Plan reteach-time

#### Culture of Error

* Create an environment where your students feel safe making and discussing mistakes
* Praise students who are brave enough to ask questions early on
* Complement improvement, not high performance
* Praise people who help each other
* Students have to be a part of building this culture also, so you need to shape their behavior too
* Students watch how you react to your own errors
* Thank people for their errors
* There might be more than one right answer, norm disagreement
* Withhold the answer - Discuss all possible answers, and help reason about each of them before giving the right one
* Look out for your "tells" about disapproving of wrong answers and being excited about right answers
* You want students to be in suspense about what the right answer is, and you're discovering it together

#### Excavate Error

* Dig into errors to understand their causes
* Assessing errors doesn't always need to happen in public or immediately- you can circle back later
* Light excavation:
    * Comparing two answers, right and wrong
    * Ask for an alternative response
    * Ask the students to come up with what a common misunderstanding might be
    * Analyze wrong choices
* Deep excavation:
    * Collect every student response, then evaluate each of them
    * Expensive- use sparingly

#### Own and Track

* Have students correct or revise their own work
* Having incorrect work gently reinforces the errors
* Some tools:
    * "Make note of any mistakes you made"
    * "Circle your mistake and make a note that it uses the wrong operator"
    * "Draw a line through the mistake and write it correctly in the margin"
    * "Make yours look like mine"
    * "Reread your response, and add at least one piece of evidence to support it"
    * "I'm coming around to check that this is in your answer"

## Academic Ethos

### Setting High Academic Expectations

#### No Opt-Out

* You provide the answer, student repeats
* Another student provides the answer, student repeats
* You provide a cue, student uses it to provide the answer
* Another student provides a cue, student uses it to provide the answer

#### Right Is Right

* "Almost right" is not good enough. Don't "round up" an answer.
