## Notes

* Standards are meaningless without assessments
* Use data to inform instruction
* Time is your most precious commodity
* Change the physical layout of the room to match the activity
    * 3 columns, 2 seats each for listening to instructors
    * Pods for discussion and group work
    * Think about aisles and alleys for easy observation
    * Use tape on the floor to indicate layouts
* Make sure the environment (such as the walls) are uncluttered and undistracting
* Direct instruction is not bad- it's an essential ingredient. Make them engaging, and no more than 15 minutes without having students practice what they're learning.
* All of our activities need to overcome the "hurdle rate" of learning, which is probably based on reading
* 3-30-30
    * 3 minutes setting expectations for work product, process, and behavior, then stand sentry (_not_ circulating) to make sure everyone starts working, then start circulating
    * 30 second burst of checking with an individual
    * 30 second burst of checking the whole group
* Make the students look forward to upcoming activities to build energy
* You can only think deeply if you know a lot- otherwise they just trade empty ideas and unfounded speculation
* Knowledge that's in your long-term memory doesn't diminish your processing capacity- knowledge that's in your short-term memory _does_
* If something has to get squeezed out of a lesson for time, it should not be the writing.
* The goal is for students to be constantly on their toes, answering questions, drawing on or developing their knowledge base, and refining their ideas
* The question isn't whether an activity is "good," but if it's the best- for that moment, that group of students, and that lesson

## Check For Understanding

### Gathering Data on Student Mastery

* You can get data through questioning or observation.

#### Reject Self-Report

* Replace rhetorical questions with more objective forms of assessment
* No "Got it?"
* They might feel like they were the only ones who didn't get it and are holding back the group
* Not _self-monitoring_:
    * Take a thoughtful assessment of themselves
    * Figure out precisely what they don't know
    * Take action to fix it

#### Targeted Questioning

* Ask multiple, quick, open-ended questions to a strategic sample of the class to get data on where they are
* Self-monitoring is expensive, targeted questioning is cheap
* Needs to be fast - 1-2 minutes
* Ask 5-6 questions to a sample of the class- cold call them
* Have the questions in advance
* The answers you get are a data set - NOT a story that culminates in the right answer

#### Standardize the Format

* Make observation easier by making it easier to find the data you're looking for
* Same tool, same place, same format- aids in gathering data quickly
* Similar physical layouts that are easier to scan
* Find out if people need more time
* Find out which options people chose
* Find out what common mistakes you could talk about during the debrief

#### Tracking, Not Watching

* Decide what you're looking for when you're scanning the classroom
* Separate _excellence_ from _completion_. Track specific errors and success points.
* Keep track of amount of error and success points, use them as data
* Track specific students to call on

#### Show Me

* Make sure students actively show you evidence of their understanding
* Hand signals (giving your their answer with a number, or a sign)
* Slates to show you their work
* Clickers for answers to multiple choice questions
* Objective data shown to the teacher in unison

#### Affirmative Checking

* Make students verify that they understand something before they move on
* Need to be able to verify that they're at the checkpoint very quickly
* Students aren't waiting for everyone else to catch up
* Students give you a signal that they're ready to be checked
* Students can do peer checking too

### Acting on the Data and the Culture of Error

* Once you have data, you need to do something with it

#### Plan for Error

* Give yourself eyes for errors by planning for common mistakes in advance
* By knowing specific mistakes in advance, you may even be able to prevent them from happening
* Have multiple paths through your lesson based on the performance
* Have more material than you need, so you can jump back, ahead, or continue on
* Plan reteach-time

#### Culture of Error

* Create an environment where your students feel safe making and discussing mistakes
* Praise students who are brave enough to ask questions early on
* Complement improvement, not high performance
* Praise people who help each other
* Students have to be a part of building this culture also, so you need to shape their behavior too
* Students watch how you react to your own errors
* Thank people for their errors
* There might be more than one right answer, norm disagreement
* Withhold the answer - Discuss all possible answers, and help reason about each of them before giving the right one
* Look out for your "tells" about disapproving of wrong answers and being excited about right answers
* You want students to be in suspense about what the right answer is, and you're discovering it together

#### Excavate Error

* Dig into errors to understand their causes
* Assessing errors doesn't always need to happen in public or immediately- you can circle back later
* Light excavation:
    * Comparing two answers, right and wrong
    * Ask for an alternative response
    * Ask the students to come up with what a common misunderstanding might be
    * Analyze wrong choices
* Deep excavation:
    * Collect every student response, then evaluate each of them
    * Expensive- use sparingly

#### Own and Track

* Have students correct or revise their own work
* Having incorrect work gently reinforces the errors
* Some tools:
    * "Make note of any mistakes you made"
    * "Circle your mistake and make a note that it uses the wrong operator"
    * "Draw a line through the mistake and write it correctly in the margin"
    * "Make yours look like mine"
    * "Reread your response, and add at least one piece of evidence to support it"
    * "I'm coming around to check that this is in your answer"

## Academic Ethos

Create a culture of "better."

### Setting High Academic Expectations

#### No Opt-Out

* Students don't get to not answer questions or just say "I don't know"
* Techniques:
    * You provide the answer, student repeats
    * Another student provides the answer, student repeats
    * You provide a cue, student uses it to provide the answer
    * Another student provides a cue, student uses it to provide the answer
* "It's ok to not know, but it's not OK not to try."    
* Show that success wasn't a fluke- get them to answer several similar questions in a row or explain the answer more thoroughly
    * Add another at bat
    * Add a stretch
    * Add an error analysis - think through how you came to that result
    * Add a "star" - positive reinforce the behavior you were looking for
* Technqiues that require thought are more rigorous than techniques that require repeating, but rigor takes time. Be more rigorous the closer you are to your learning objective.

#### Right Is Right

* "Almost right" is not good enough. Don't "round up" an answer- make them get all the way there themselves
* Hold them to the appropriate level of rigor
* It's hard to hold out for "all the way right" if you don't know what that is beforehand- script your questions and your answers
* Be wary of "I know what she was trying to say"
* Things students will do to get away from right-is-right answers:
    * "The Kitchen Sink" - Say everything you know about the topic until the teacher stops you
    * "Bait and Switch" - Answer the question you wish you were asked
    * "Heartfelt Topic" - Say something sincere and obvious about the topic
    * "Vague Vagaries" - Use imprecise language
* Be careful about a student who anticipates and answers the next questions ahead of time- _they_ got there, but the class didn't
* Techniques:
    * Hold out for all-the-way right (don't round up)
    * Answer my question (make your students be disciplined)
    * Right answer, right time (don't reward rushing ahead)
    * Specific vocabulary (lock in the precise words)

#### Stretch It

* Reward correct answers with harder questions
* Ask a diversity of types of questions
    * Ask how or why
    * Ask for another way to answer
    * Ask for a better word or more precise explanation
    * Ask for evidence
    * Ask students to integrate a related skill
    * Ask students to apply the same skill in a new setting
    * Use a non-directive prompt:
        * "Say more"
        * "Keep going"
        * "Develop"
        * _Keep going gesture_
        * _Head nod_
        * _Raised eyebrows_
* Build a culture around the idea that learning is never done
    * "When I overcome a challenge, I look forward to the next"
* Follow-up questions are more expensive, but also more targeted than prompts
* Students can know how stretch-it works- you can be transparent

#### Format Matters

* Hold students to a high standard of delivery, not just ideas
* Grammar, complete sentences, and voice all matter
* There's different language for different settings
* Techniques:
    * Interrogative- Repeat the mistake back to them
    * Begin the correction - Start the correction and let them finish
    * Prompt them- "Who can answer like a scholar?"
    * If not loud enough- "Voice please"

#### Without Apology

* Embrace rigorous content, challenge and hard work
* Don't assume something will be boring ("Let's just try to get through this")
* Don't blame the content ("They say we have to do this")
* Don't try to make it more accessible by dulling it down
* Don't make excuses for students

### Planning For Success

These happen before you come to class. Don't crowd out high-value planning tasks with low-value ones.

#### Begin With The End

* Work background from unit planning to lesson planning
* Define the objective, how you'll assess, and then choose activities
* Instead of figuring out what you're going to do tomorrow, figure out what you want students to _learn_ tomorrow
* The question to ask when choosing activities- is it the fastest way to reach my goal?

#### 4 M's

* Lesson objectives should be manageable, measurable, made first, and most important
    * Manageable - Can be taught in a single lesson
    * Measurable - Be able to assess how successful you were by the end of the lesson
    * Made First- Don't justify a topic or an activity with an objective. An objective is the tool you're using to push a class forward, based on data.
    * Most Important - The next step up the mountain

#### Post It

* Display your objectives where everyone can see them
* Same location every time

#### Double-Plan

* As you plan, plan what students will be doing at each step
* Lesson packets are things that students use to follow along during a lesson
    * Keep everything in one place during the lesson to minimize disruption
    * Put notes in the margins of the packets for pacing, questions, "stage notes", etc.
    * Keep making notes during the lesson for revisions and notes based on captured data, pacing notes, performance data, etc.
    * Packets reduce transaction costs with switching topics, activities, pacing, etc. ("Flip to the yellow section")
    * Packets keep students and instructors accountable
    * Include rubrics and tips
    * Embed adapatibility- include more than you need to


### Lesson Structure

* Guided Practice - I do, we do, you do
    1. I do
        * Do good showing (modeling) and telling (explaining)
        * Preteach the pitfalls
    1. I do, you help
    1. You do, I help
        * Get more cognitive work out of the audience
        * Feigned ignorance
    1. You do
    1. You do, and do, and do
        * Very few students get it on the first or second try
        * Go until they can do it on their own
        * Use multiple variations and formats
        * Have enrichment problems ready to go
* Consistent structures reduce the cognitive load on the content

#### Do Now

* Short warm-up that the students can do without instruction or direction to start the day
* Keep it in the same place every day
* If you have to give directions, it's not independent enough
* It should be obvious whether or not they've done it
* It should either preview or review
* It should be quick to do, and quick to debrief
* Start the day after the Do-Now

#### Name the Steps

* Break down complex tasks into discrete, repeatable steps
* Decompose all of the things experts do intuitively into steps
* Needs to be fewer than 7
* You can teach corner-cases and complexity, but keep the actual steps simple
* Name the steps and use mnemonics to make them "sticky"
* Two stairways- Work on problems in the abstract and specific at the same time

#### Board = Paper

* Model how students should be taking notes to capture the information
* Students often need help learning to be students as much as they do learning the content
* "Make your paper look like mine"

#### Control the Game

* Ask students to read out loud frequently, but actively manage the process
* Reading is critical to success, but not _just_ silent reading
    * Independent reading is hard to hold people accountable for
    * You can combine these with a task- "Read the next paragraph, write a summary of it, then we'll pick up again together"
* When one student is reading aloud, the other students need to be reading too
* Reading aloud gives you a chance to catch and correct reading issues
* Their inflection and tone gives you some sense of how well they understand it
* Technique:
    * Vary the time so that students don't know when their turn will be
    * Keep the durations generally short
    * Don't make the next reader predictable
    * Keep the transaction costs low
    * Use yourself as a "bridge"- model expressiveness, etc.
        * Spot-check/Oral Cloze- make students finish your sentence to get them back on track
    * When you want them to focus on you, have them hold their place and close their books

#### Circulate

* Move strategically around the room
* "Break the plane"- get out from the desk to add energy
    * This should happen during the first 5 minutes of any lesson
    * It's your room, and you need to norm being able to be in any part of it
* You need full access to everyone, or you'll have places that are easy to hide in
* Types of interactions:
    * Simple walk-by, slowly monitoring
    * Non-verbal- thumbs up, keep going, pat on the shoulder
    * Read and review- Non-invasive
    * Pick-up read- you interrupt the student to study their work
* You can "dot" students work to note an error- don't tell them how to fix it, just note it
* Be systematic to get the whole room, but not predictable
* Always try to stay facing the class, even as you circulate

#### At Bats

* Give lots of practice- succeeding once or twice isn't mastery
* Go until they can do it on their own
* Give them multiple variations and formats
* Grab opportunities for enrichment and differentiation for students who master it quickly

#### Exit Ticket

* End each class with an assessment of your objective
* 1-3 questions, multiple formats
* Designed to yield data
* Can be used as Do-Nows the following day
* Reviewing data:
    * Sort them into yes/no/some- potentially use for groups
* If comprehension is low across the board, reteach
* If only a few students are struggling, do a breakout
* Write the exit ticket first

### Pacing

* Pacing isn't the speed, it's the perception of speed
* "Don't do anything for more than 10 minutes"
* Too _much_ perception of speed, and the energy can get out of control, you need to balance

#### Change the Pace

* Create fast or slow moments in your class by shifting activity types or formats
* 5 kinds of activties:
    * Knowledge assimilation - Via direct instruction or reading
    * Guided practice or guided questioning
    * Independent practice (doing, not reading)
    * Reflecting (quietly and deeply, idea generation, brainstorming)
    * Discussion and developing with classmates
* Knowledge assimilation has to precede the others
* You don't need to change the activities every 10 minutes, sometimes just the delivery of the same activity
* Celebrate mile markers to give the illusion of speed

#### Brighten Lines

* Make beginnings and endings of activities visible and crisp
* Start everyone at once
    * Creates strong social incentives
    * Use tone to convey exactly what they should do
        * "Go!" - Hustle
        * "Begin." - Be contemplative
* End an activity cleanly _together_
    * Make sure that the transition is efficient to save time
* You can make them interactive- have them say "Go!" or do a particular signal at the end of a countdown

#### All Hands

* Leverage hand-raising to help with pacing
* Raising your hand is powerful- it means "I want to participate"
* Each question/answer is a different event, and responses should build on each other
* Don't let students keep their hands up while someone else is talking- help them build the habit
* Occasionally limit the number of people who can raise their hands (by part of the room, table, demographics, etc.)
* Unbundle big questions into smaller ones to increase participation
* Ask follow-on questions to help build a discussion instead of just having a disconnected set of comments
* Cut off ramblers with "pause- " and then redirect them

#### Work the Clock

* Measure your time intentionally and strategically to shape your experience
* Showing the clock helps build a time-sensitive culture
* Clocks help keep your students and you accountable to your goals
* Use odd time intervals- round numbers have an implied "around..." in front of them
* You want to create the highest value in the least amount of time, it should not be a rush
* You control the clock, not the students- don't let their behavior dictate how firm you are
* Have them wrap up activities and transition very quickly

#### Every Minute Matters

* Respect student's time by spending every minute productively
* Pay attention to squandered moments- minutes at the end of class, etc.
* Have back pocket activities ready to go:
    * Reviews
    * Challenge activities
    * Quiz and vocab questions
    * Reading activities
    * You can literally write them and keep them in your back pocket
* If something is bombing, figure out how quickly you can switch to something of value

## Ratio

### Building Ratio Through Questioning

* The workout belongs to the student
* You need high engagement _and_ high rigor
* You need a high "think ratio" and a high "participation ratio"
    * You may have to prioritize one over the other occasionally
    * High-ratio activities where students don't know enough facts are not meaningful
    * You need to make an investment in teaching facts first

#### Wait Time

* Allow students time to think before answering a question
* Help narrate them toward being more productive
* Benefits:
    * Allows more hands to go up
    * Enabling a wider range of people to engage
    * Supporting better, more rigorous answers
    * Prompting more cognitive work during the "wait"
    * Decreasing the number of students who can't answer
    * Increasing use of evidence in answers
1. Wait time is ineffective if you don't have a culture where everyone wants to answer
    * You may have to reset the expectation if you see blank faces
    * You can count the hands- "One hand, two hands, three..."
    * "Hands down- I want you all to take 15 seconds to locate the answer"
1. Prompt them with thinking skills
    * "I'm seeing lots of note-taking and furrowed brows- I like that"
    * "I'm giving lots of time because this is tricky- your first answer may not be your best"
1. Be silent- don't interrupt their thinking
1. Tell them how much time they'll have and how much depth you want

#### Cold Call

* Call on students regardless of whether they've raised their hands
* Purpose:
    1. CFU - Helps you be systematic about who you're calling on
    1. Engagement & Accountability - Shows that the students don't control their level of participation
    1. Pacing - Begging students to answer slows the pace and takes up too much time
    1. Ratio - Makes students use things like wait time more effectively
* Keys to effective cold-calling:
    * Predictable - That it might be coming is what brings up ratio
    * Systematic - Not meant to single anyone out
    * Positive - Not a "gotcha"- who wouldn't want to participate?
    * Unbundle - Break it up into small pieces to increase participation
* Variants:
    * Hands-up / Hands-down - You can also allow students to volunteer or not
    * Follow-on / Follow-up - Ask students to develop on each other's ideas
    * Name timing - Calling the name last is higher ratio, calling the name first increases their chance of getting a win
    * Slow call - Use it as an opportunity to increase wait time
    * Turn and talk, followed by a cold call
    * Data drive cold calls- Script them ahead of time, and indicate which part of the sample you want to target them to

#### Call and Response

* Ask your class to answer questions in unison from time to time to build energy and engagement
* Benefits:
    * Academic review and reinforcement- everyone gets the answer
    * High-energy fun
    * Behavioral reinforcement- increases compliance
* Types of call and response:
    * Repeat - Fill in the blank
    * Report - "Give me your answer on 3"
    * Reinforce - Make everyone repeat a student's exemplar answer
    * Review - Multiple questions asked quickly
    * Solve - Take time to answer the question- needs to be a clear answer that everyone should get
* Needs a strong cue to get everyone to respond, to differentiate from a different kind of question
* Stretchable - make them say more of the phrase on repeat

#### Break It Down

* When a student makes an error, provide just enough help unblock them
* This is very hard, and easy to destroy the rigor
* Ways to do it:
    * Provide an example
    * Provide context
    * Provide a rule
    * Provide a missing (or first) step
    * Roll back - Repeat their response to them and emphasize the part they got wrong
    * Eliminate false choices
* Make sure you connect it back to the rigor of the original question

#### Pepper

* A fast-paced vocal review to build energy
* Doesn't build new skills, just helps build energy
* No discussion, just action
* Fast-paced, unpredictable review
* Good for warm-ups
* Should feel like a game
* Can pick student names randomly (or at least appear like you do)

### Building Ratio Through Writing

The amount and quality of writing students do are the most important thing students can do. Writing is ideal for summary and synthesis.

#### Everybody Writes

* Give them the chance to reflect in writing before you ask them to discuss
* Writing helps turn a notion into an idea, which is a good entry ticket to a discussion
* The first person to raise their hand or talk just had the fastest idea, which is rarely the best idea
* You can use this as an opportunity to "hunt and gather" for good starting points in your discussion
* Can be the basis for good cold-calling
* Writing increases ratio and retention

#### Art of the Sentence

* Synthesize a complex idea into a single well-crafted sentence
* Give them a sentence starter:
    * "Growing exponentially, ..."
    * "The relationship between..."
    * "In the long run..."
* You can give your sentences parameters:
    * Include a word or phrase
    * Address multiple things
    * With a length limit
* Good at the end of a lesson, because it helps summarize
* Good as an exit ticket

#### Show Call

* Increase the effort that goes into writing by publicly showcasing and revising work, without volunteers
* A visual form of cold calll
* Helps students learn how to edit
* You can ask their permission ahead of time
* Three questions for a show call:
    1. What kind of work? Can be:
        * Exemplary- show how to achieve success
        * A common error- opportunity to correct something common
        * A blend of strengths and weaknesses- Show how to take something from good to great
    1. When? Can be:
        * After writing is complete
        * After revising is complete - To hold students accountable for learning something
        * During writing - If it's a longer prompt, gives a mile marker
    1. How many?
        * Deep with one
        * Coverage with multiple
* Accountable revision techniques
    1. Check or change- Either affirm that an answer is correct or fix it, but everyone has to write
    1. Offline revision- After a show call, make everyone do the revisions they learned and then show call again
    1. Live edit- During a show call, everyone fixes their work in place
* Two key moments during a show call:
    1. The take - Try to be emotionless or positive when you take their work
    1. The reveal - Do you keep it anonymous? Read it out loud or have everyone read it silently? Do you tell them what to look for?

#### Build Stamina

* Gradually increase writing time to build stamina for longer writing
* Start small and build up
* "I should see all pencils moving" - Might not be a best practice for all writing, but helps build the stamina
* Prime the pump - Come up with some ideas before the session starts
* Valorize student writing- savor it, read it out loud, and show pride in it

#### Front the Writing

* Put writing closer to the front of the lesson to ensure students think rigorously
* It's very easy to get false-positives in mastery by having discussions or writing at the end
* Put the writing up front to avoid students "piggy-backing"
* Format should be: Read-Write-Discuss-Revise

### Building Ratio Through Discussion

* Discussions are not people restating their opinions to each other
    * You need to react to the things being said
* Spend less time steering the content of a discussion, and more time steering the format

#### Habits of Discussion

* Normalize a set of ground rules to make your discussions more productive
* Parts:
    1. Fundamentals: Voice, tracking, and names
        * Loud enough to be heard
        * Look at the person you're talking to
        * Use their name
    1. Follow-on / Follow-on Prompting
        * Cold-call students to respond to the previous statement
    1. Sentence-starters
        * Their first sentence should show the relationship between the present and the previous sentence in some respectful way
        * You can post them on the wall for students to refer to until they get the hang of it
        * "I understand why you'd say that, but..."
        * "Another example of that is..."
        * "Thing that doesn't take into account is..."
    1. Managing the meta
        * Try to keep discussions "inside the box"- focused and reflective, rather than too divergent
        * "How does that relate to what we were just talking about?"
        * Move a topic on when it stops being productive

#### Turn and Talk

* Have short pair discussions to help students formulate their thoughts
* Almost always an early-or-middle stage activity
* Assign pairs ahead of time and have them sit next to each other- looking for a partner is a waste of time
* Manage the turns- "Short hair to long hair" is a way of saying the person with the shorter hair starts first, and you may prompt them to switch at some point
* Prompt them to wind it down to avoid cutting someone off
* End a turn and talk when the ideas are bustling the hardest, not when they're tapering- this keeps the energy high
* Be precise with the time you'll afford them, so they know how deep to go with their point
* Ask them to present their partner's viewpoint
* Don't let discussions spread low-quality or erroneous ideas
    * On its own, turn and talk is low rigor and should be followed up with a higher rigor activity
    * Do a whole-class analysis of the discussions
    * Lead into a whole-class analysis
    * Lead into a writing activity where they have to reflect on the discussions
    * Whole group discussion into a writing activity

#### Batch Process

* Give students autonomy and ownership by allowing them to have unmediated discussions
* Sometimes callled a socratic discussion, a socratic seminar, or a fishbowl
* Works better with smaller groups (<12)
* Timebox it to something short (2 minutes)
* Have them generate topics- "What's worthy of analysis in this?"
