## Notes

* Standards are meaningless without assessments
* Use data to inform instruction
* Time is your most precious commodity
* Change the physical layout of the room to match the activity
    * 3 columns, 2 seats each for listening to instructors
    * Pods for discussion and group work
    * Think about aisles and alleys for easy observation
    * Use tape on the floor to indicate layouts
* Make sure the environment (such as the walls) are uncluttered and undistracting
* Direct instruction is not bad- it's an essential ingredient. Make them engaging, and no more than 15 minutes without having students practice what they're learning.

## Check For Understanding

### Gathering Data on Student Mastery

* You can get data through questioning or observation.

#### Reject Self-Report

* Replace rhetorical questions with more objective forms of assessment
* No "Got it?"
* They might feel like they were the only ones who didn't get it and are holding back the group
* Not _self-monitoring_:
    * Take a thoughtful assessment of themselves
    * Figure out precisely what they don't know
    * Take action to fix it

#### Targeted Questioning

* Ask multiple, quick, open-ended questions to a strategic sample of the class to get data on where they are
* Self-monitoring is expensive, targeted questioning is cheap
* Needs to be fast - 1-2 minutes
* Ask 5-6 questions to a sample of the class- cold call them
* Have the questions in advance
* The answers you get are a data set - NOT a story that culminates in the right answer

#### Standardize the Format

* Make observation easier by making it easier to find the data you're looking for
* Same tool, same place, same format- aids in gathering data quickly
* Similar physical layouts that are easier to scan
* Find out if people need more time
* Find out which options people chose
* Find out what common mistakes you could talk about during the debrief

#### Tracking, Not Watching

* Decide what you're looking for when you're scanning the classroom
* Separate _excellence_ from _completion_. Track specific errors and success points.
* Keep track of amount of error and success points, use them as data
* Track specific students to call on

#### Show Me

* Make sure students actively show you evidence of their understanding
* Hand signals (giving your their answer with a number, or a sign)
* Slates to show you their work
* Clickers for answers to multiple choice questions
* Objective data shown to the teacher in unison

#### Affirmative Checking

* Make students verify that they understand something before they move on
* Need to be able to verify that they're at the checkpoint very quickly
* Students aren't waiting for everyone else to catch up
* Students give you a signal that they're ready to be checked
* Students can do peer checking too

### Acting on the Data and the Culture of Error

* Once you have data, you need to do something with it

#### Plan for Error

* Give yourself eyes for errors by planning for common mistakes in advance
* By knowing specific mistakes in advance, you may even be able to prevent them from happening
* Have multiple paths through your lesson based on the performance
* Have more material than you need, so you can jump back, ahead, or continue on
* Plan reteach-time

#### Culture of Error

* Create an environment where your students feel safe making and discussing mistakes
* Praise students who are brave enough to ask questions early on
* Complement improvement, not high performance
* Praise people who help each other
* Students have to be a part of building this culture also, so you need to shape their behavior too
* Students watch how you react to your own errors
* Thank people for their errors
* There might be more than one right answer, norm disagreement
* Withhold the answer - Discuss all possible answers, and help reason about each of them before giving the right one
* Look out for your "tells" about disapproving of wrong answers and being excited about right answers
* You want students to be in suspense about what the right answer is, and you're discovering it together

#### Excavate Error

* Dig into errors to understand their causes
* Assessing errors doesn't always need to happen in public or immediately- you can circle back later
* Light excavation:
    * Comparing two answers, right and wrong
    * Ask for an alternative response
    * Ask the students to come up with what a common misunderstanding might be
    * Analyze wrong choices
* Deep excavation:
    * Collect every student response, then evaluate each of them
    * Expensive- use sparingly

#### Own and Track

* Have students correct or revise their own work
* Having incorrect work gently reinforces the errors
* Some tools:
    * "Make note of any mistakes you made"
    * "Circle your mistake and make a note that it uses the wrong operator"
    * "Draw a line through the mistake and write it correctly in the margin"
    * "Make yours look like mine"
    * "Reread your response, and add at least one piece of evidence to support it"
    * "I'm coming around to check that this is in your answer"

## Academic Ethos

Create a culture of "better."

### Setting High Academic Expectations

#### No Opt-Out

* Students don't get to not answer questions or just say "I don't know"
* Techniques:
    * You provide the answer, student repeats
    * Another student provides the answer, student repeats
    * You provide a cue, student uses it to provide the answer
    * Another student provides a cue, student uses it to provide the answer
* "It's ok to not know, but it's not OK not to try."    
* Show that success wasn't a fluke- get them to answer several similar questions in a row or explain the answer more thoroughly
    * Add another at bat
    * Add a stretch
    * Add an error analysis - think through how you came to that result
    * Add a "star" - positive reinforce the behavior you were looking for
* Technqiues that require thought are more rigorous than techniques that require repeating, but rigor takes time. Be more rigorous the closer you are to your learning objective.

#### Right Is Right

* "Almost right" is not good enough. Don't "round up" an answer- make them get all the way there themselves
* Hold them to the appropriate level of rigor
* It's hard to hold out for "all the way right" if you don't know what that is beforehand- script your questions and your answers
* Be wary of "I know what she was trying to say"
* Things students will do to get away from right-is-right answers:
    * "The Kitchen Sink" - Say everything you know about the topic until the teacher stops you
    * "Bait and Switch" - Answer the question you wish you were asked
    * "Heartfelt Topic" - Say something sincere and obvious about the topic
    * "Vague Vagaries" - Use imprecise language
* Be careful about a student who anticipates and answers the next questions ahead of time- _they_ got there, but the class didn't
* Techniques:
    * Hold out for all-the-way right (don't round up)
    * Answer my question (make your students be disciplined)
    * Right answer, right time (don't reward rushing ahead)
    * Specific vocabulary (lock in the precise words)

#### Stretch It

* Reward correct answers with harder questions
* Ask a diversity of types of questions
    * Ask how or why
    * Ask for another way to answer
    * Ask for a better word or more precise explanation
    * Ask for evidence
    * Ask students to integrate a related skill
    * Ask students to apply the same skill in a new setting
    * Use a non-directive prompt:
        * "Say more"
        * "Keep going"
        * "Develop"
        * _Keep going gesture_
        * _Head nod_
        * _Raised eyebrows_
* Build a culture around the idea that learning is never done
    * "When I overcome a challenge, I look forward to the next"
* Follow-up questions are more expensive, but also more targeted than prompts
* Students can know how stretch-it works- you can be transparent

#### Format Matters

* Hold students to a high standard of delivery, not just ideas
* Grammar, complete sentences, and voice all matter
* There's different language for different settings
* Techniques:
    * Interrogative- Repeat the mistake back to them
    * Begin the correction - Start the correction and let them finish
    * Prompt them- "Who can answer like a scholar?"
    * If not loud enough- "Voice please"

#### Without Apology

* Embrace rigorous content, challenge and hard work
* Don't assume something will be boring ("Let's just try to get through this")
* Don't blame the content ("They say we have to do this")
* Don't try to make it more accessible by dulling it down
* Don't make excuses for students

### Planning For Success

These happen before you come to class. Don't crowd out high-value planning tasks with low-value ones.

#### Begin With The End

* Work background from unit planning to lesson planning
* Define the objective, how you'll assess, and then choose activities
* Instead of figuring out what you're going to do tomorrow, figure out what you want students to _learn_ tomorrow
* The question to ask when choosing activities- is it the fastest way to reach my goal?

#### 4 M's

* Lesson objectives should be manageable, measurable, made first, and most important
    * Manageable - Can be taught in a single lesson
    * Measurable - Be able to assess how successful you were by the end of the lesson
    * Made First- Don't justify a topic or an activity with an objective. An objective is the tool you're using to push a class forward, based on data.
    * Most Important - The next step up the mountain

#### Post It

* Display your objectives where everyone can see them
* Same location every time

#### Double-Plan

* As you plan, plan what students will be doing at each step
* Lesson packets are things that students use to follow along during a lesson
    * Keep everything in one place during the lesson to minimize disruption
    * Put notes in the margins of the packets for pacing, questions, "stage notes", etc.
    * Keep making notes during the lesson for revisions and notes based on captured data, pacing notes, performance data, etc.
    * Packets reduce transaction costs with switching topics, activities, pacing, etc. ("Flip to the yellow section")
    * Packets keep students and instructors accountable
    * Include rubrics and tips
    * Embed adapatibility- include more than you need to


### Lesson Structure

* Guided Practice - I do, we do, you do
    1. I do
        * Do good showing (modeling) and telling (explaining)
        * Preteach the pitfalls
    1. I do, you help
    1. You do, I help
        * Get more cognitive work out of the audience
        * Feigned ignorance
    1. You do
    1. You do, and do, and do
        * Very few students get it on the first or second try
        * Go until they can do it on their own
        * Use multiple variations and formats
        * Have enrichment problems ready to go

#### Do Now

* Short warm-up that the students can do without instruction or direction to start the day
* Keep it in the same place every day
* If you have to give directions, it's not independent enough
* It should be obvious whether or not they've done it
* It should either preview or review
* It should be quick to do, and quick to debrief
* Start the day after the Do-Now

#### Name the Steps

* Break down complex tasks into discrete, repeatable steps
* Decompose all of the things experts do intuitively into steps

#### Board = Paper

* Model how students should be taking notes to capture the information

#### Control the Game

* Ask students to read out loud frequently, but actively manage the process

#### Circulate

* Move strategically around the room

#### At Bats

* Give lots of practice- succeeding once or twice isn't mastery

#### Exit Ticket

* End each class with an assessment of your objective
