* You've compressed too much when it has too much detail, gets smaller, loses tone. Use automation or clip gain instead.
* If you put a compressor before a reverb, it sounds smooth and natural. If you put the reverb before the compressor, it makes the reverb jump out.
* Corrective EQ before compressor, creative EQ after compressor
* Bus compression makes things that serve the same function in a mix glue together
* Compressor distorts if you set attack and release faster than the wave length of a low frequency
* Compress an instrument if you need to control its dynamics or if you need to impact a compressor's character

## Controls

* Fast attack cuts off transient, slow attack is more punchy
* Fast release sounds more real, slow release sounds more compressed
* Auto-release will choose slow or fast based on the transients

## Process

1. Get a few dB of compression by lowering the threshold at 2:1
1. Set the ratio to the desired amount
1. Set the makeup gain to match the uncompressed sound
1. Adjust the attack and release

## Types

* Opto. Uses a lightbulb and a photocell. Fat, smooth. Naturally slow attack and release because of the time it takes change the bulb's intensity. Bass, vocals, synthesizers.
* Vari-Mu. Uses a series of tubes and alters their bias. Naturally slow attack. Big low-end, fat and smooth. Good for bus compression.
* FET. Colored. Fast. Good for drums, punching through the mix. Aggressive, punchy.
* VCA. Uses voltage-controlled amplifier. Lots of control. Glueing together. Very versatile, most transparent.

## Series Compression

* Use 2-3 compressors to make it more subtle, without bringing out a lot of detail
* 2-3 dB per compressor, lower ratios
* Smoother, more transparent
* Popular on vocals and bass
* Lets you use the sonic characteristics of both
* On vocals, this is a solution to harsh sibilance

## Parallel Compression

* Fatter

## Harrison Leveler

* General gain riding- similar to a finger on a fader
* Low ratio, very transparent
* Good for dynamic vocalists and bass players
* Should show nearly constant gain reduction
* LA2A, brings a singer closer to you

## Harrison Compressor

* Attack/release combined into "speed"
* Extends sustain
* Pumps
* Glues

## Harrison Limiter

* Tames sharp transients
* Good on acoustic guitar
* Shapes transients of drums
* Good for broadcast-style limiting

## Parallel Compression

* Brings up softest sounds to add detail
* Common on drums
* Send to two different busses
    * Don't have to include the same channels!
* Smash the parallel bus hard
* Include a little high and low EQ
