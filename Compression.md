* Fast attack cuts off transient, slow attack is more punchy
* Fast release sounds more real, slow release sounds more compressed

## Process

1. Get a few dB of compression by lowering the threshold at 2:1
1. Set the ratio to the desired amount
1. Set the makeup gain to match the uncompressed sound
1. Adjust the attack and release

## Harrison Leveler

* General gain riding- similar to a finger on a fader
* Low ratio, very transparent
* Good for dynamic vocalists and bass players
* Should show nearly constant gain reduction
* LA2A, brings a singer closer to you

## Harrison Compressor

* Attack/release combined into "speed"
* Extends sustain
* Pumps
* Glues

## Harrison Limiter

* Tames sharp transients
* Good on acoustic guitar
* Shapes transients of drums
* Good for broadcast-style limiting

## Parallel Compression

* Brings up softest sounds to add detail
* Common on drums
* Send to two different busses
    * Don't have to include the same channels!
* Smash the parallel bus hard
* Include a little high and low EQ
