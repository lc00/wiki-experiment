[Elements of Value](https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-elements-of-value)

* Modeled after Maslow's hierarchy
* Different pieces that customers all attach some value to
* Customers generally need to have elements at bottom met before valuing ones at top
* You can charge more for values closer to the top of the pyramid
    * Conversely, when charging more money, find ways to add value higher up
* Quality (how good it does its job) affects loyalty more than any other value
* After quality, the most important ones are industry-specific
