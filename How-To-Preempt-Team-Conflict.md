Have 5 conversations with the team. Everything should start with "in my world" and "in your world".

## Look

* What makes a good first impression? A Bad one?
* What do you notice first about others? (Dress, speech, demeanor)
* What does that make think about them? (ridid, pushy, lazy)
* What intangible credentials do you value? (education, experience, connections)
* How do you perceive status differences?

## Act

* How important are punctuality and time-limits?
* Are there consequences of being late or missing deadlines?
* What is a comfortable physical distance for interacting in the workplace?
* Should people volunteer for assignments or wait to be nominated?
* What group behaviors are valued? (helping others, not complaining)

## Speak

* Is a promise an aspiration or a guarantee?
* Which is most important, directness or harmony?
* Are irony and sarcasm appreciated?
* Do interruptions signal interest or rudeness?
* Does silence mean reflection or disengagement?
* Should dissenting views be aired in public or discussed off-line?
* Is unsolicited feedback welcome?

## Think

* Is uncertainty viewed as a threat or an opportunity?
* What's more important: the big picture or the details?
* Is it better to be reliable or flexible?
* What is your attitude toward failure?
* How do people tolerate deviations from the plan?

## Feel

* What emotions (positive and negative) are acceptable and unacceptable to display in a business context?
* How do people express anger or enthusiasm?
* How would you react if you were annoyed with a teammate? (with silence, body language, humor, through a third-party)
