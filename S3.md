## Buckets

Cheap file storage, organized into buckets of objects. You can also configure a bucket as a static site or redirect to another URL.

### Options

* You can enable versioning to make S3 keep track of all versions of an object
* You can enable logging to see all access to your bucket
* You can have different levels of access for different users
* You can set different levels of access frequency for a bucket, and different levels of redundancy
* You can encrypt your files or not

Files have to be public to be read directly by the web. You can use this to host websites, at a cost of about $0.03/GB/Month for storage and $0.09/GB/Month for transfer.

### Snapshots of EBS Volumes

The goal is to take a snapshot of the EBS at a known point, then provision a new EC2 and attach that EBS in the case of a failure.

Backup:

1. Stop the instance
2. Elastic Block Store -> Volumes -> Create Snapshot
3. Label snapshot
4. Elastic Block Store -> Snapshots -> Actions -> Create Image
    * Defaults are fine, but make sure to change virtualization type from paravirtual to hardware-assisted virtualization
5. Restart the instance

Recovery:

1. Images -> AMIs -> Launch

### OS Backups

Backup:

1. `tar czf backup.tar.gz /etc /var /home`
2. `aws s3 cp backup.tar.gz s3://BucketNameHere`

Recovery:

1. Dowload backup file
2. Copy results over your directories

## CLI

Works from local to s3, s3 to local, or between buckets

Common actions:

* `cp`
* `ls`
* `mv`
* `rm`
* `sync`

* Upload to bucket: `aws s3 cp some-local-file.md s3://bucket-name`
* List buckets: `aws s3 ls`
* List files in buckets: `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name`
* Sync a local folder to s3: `aws s3 sync . s3://bucket-name`
* Sync bucket to local folder: `aws s3 sync local-file`
    * `--delete` flag deletes stuff that's in the destination but not in the source
