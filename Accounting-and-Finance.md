|                     | Sales & Revenue |
| Gross Profit/Margin | - COGS          |

## 3 Areas of Finance

* Financial Management
* Capital Markets
* Investments

## Corporate Structures

* Proprietorships
* Partnerships
* Corporations - C & S
* LLC
* LLP

## Intrinsic Value

* Intrinsic value: Based on actual risk and return
* Market value: What something is trading at

Always manage for intrinsic value, not market price.

## Motivating Executives

* Undervalued stocks are at risk from hostile takeovers
* Angry boards fire managers
* Tie compensation to intrinsic value
* Bondholder interests can compete with stockholder interests
* Ignoring stakeholder value can cause society to bite back and take it out on the company

## Markets & Institutions

### 3 Ways Capital is Moved Around

Capital can be moved between business and savers 3 ways:

* Directly: Savers give a business money, a business gives the saver securities
* Primary Market Transaction: Savers and business trade money and securities directly through an investment bank that underwrites their transactions
* Secondary Market Transaction: Businesses sell securities to an intermediary (like a bank), who sells CDs and notes to savers. Savers give cash the intermediary, who gives money to the business.

### Types of Markets

* Physical markets: Goods
* Financial markets: Stocks and bonds
    * Derivatives are "derived" from financial markets, like options
        * Derivatives either hedge risk or speculate
        * Credit default swap: One institution insuring the investment of another in exchange for regular payments
    * Spot markets: Immediately
    * Futures markets: Agree to buy and sell at a set price in the future
    * Money market: Short-term, liquid debt
    * Capital market: Intermediate/long-term d ebt, stocks
    * Primary market: Corporations raising capital directly
    * Secondary market: Investors trade with each other (eg. stock exchanges)
    * Private market: Negotiated directly between parties
    * Public markets: Structured, standardized transactions on exchanges

### Institutions

* Investment bank: Helps companies raise capital and design securities
* Commercial banks: "Finance department stores"
* Financial services corporations: Large conglomerates
* Credit unions: member to member
* Pension funds: Retirement plans administered by commercial banks or institutions
* Life insurance companies: Invest funds for a payout
* Mutual funds: Diversify investments to reduce risk
* Exchange Traded Funds (ETF): In a specific area, shares in a mutual funds are traded like stocks
* Hedge fund: Unregulated, big minimums, hedge bets or speculative investments
* Private equity firms: Buy entire companies

### Stock Market

* Establishes a firm's stock price
* Physical (NYSE) vs. electronic (NASDAQ)

Brokerages have reps on the NYSE that take buy and sell orders and put them through a Specialist.

### Dealer Market

* Facilities
* Few dealers who "make the market"
* Lots of brokers who bring dealers and investers together
* The network between dealers and brokers
* Bid price: what a dealer will pay
* Ask price: what a dealer will sell for
* Bid-ask spread: Dealer's margin, will be wide if risky

### Common Stock

* "Closely Held": Privately owned, active management
* "Publicly Owned": Lots of inactive investors
* Bought on:
    * Secondary market
    * Primary market
    * IPO
* Dutch auction: Investors bid, and highest price ("Clearing price") that would cause all shares to sell

### Indexes

* Dow Jones Industrial Average
* S&P500
* NASDAQ Composite

---

* Market price: Current price
* Intrinsic value: Real value w/ all possible information
* Equillibrium price: Buy and sell orders balance out
* Efficient market: Market price = intrinsic value, and equillibrium between buy and sell orders
    * High volatility indicates an inefficient market
    * Markets aren't efficient because people view potential gain and potential loss differently

## Statements, Cash Flow, Taxes

### Annual Report

* Verbal section
* Balance sheet - What we have, what we owe
* Income statement - Sales & costs
* Statement of cash flows - Beginning and ending cash, and what changed it
* Statement of stockholder equity - Beginning and ending equity, what changed it

### Balance Sheet

Snapshot at a point in time.

#### Assets

* Current Assets (Cash, stocks, accounts receivable, inventory)
* Fixed assets (Equipment, real estate)

#### Liabilities

* Current liabilities (Wages, taxes, account payable)
* Long-term debt
* Stockholder equity

---

* Stockholder equity: Paid-in capital + retained earnings. Also, total assets - total liabilities.
* Working capital = current assets
* Net working capital = current assets - current liabilities
* "Free" liability is non-interest bearing

### Income Statement (P&L)

Income over a period of time.

* Net Sales
* - Operating Costs
* - Interest
* - Taxes
* = Net income
    * / Shares = EPS (the "bottom line")
    * - Dividends Paid = Retained Earnings on the balance sheet

---

* Operating income/EBIT = Sales - Operating costs
    * Income derived from your core business
    * Use this to compare the operating performance of 2 companies
* Depreciation: Loss of value of equipment over time
* Amortization: Same but for intangibles (patents, copyrights, trademarks, goodwill)
* EBITDA: How much cash are you generating?

### Statement of Cash Flows

All items are expected to generate cash at some point.

| Category         | Cash Flows |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Operating        | + 819      |
| Investing        | - 448      |
| Financing        | - 206      |
|------------------|------------|
| Summary          |   165      |
| + Beginning cash |   140      |
|------------------|------------|
| Ending cash      |   305      |

When you're out of cash, you're out of business.

### Statement of Stockholder Equity

Retained earnings are a claim against assets, not a cash-equivalent. They aren't liquid.

Equity: Shareholder's capital + retained earnings

| Activity          | Amount |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Retained Earnings |  425   |
| Net Income        | +168   |
| Dividends         |  -93   |
| Retained Earnings |  500   |

---

Free cash flow: The amount of cash that could be withdrawn without hurting operations

```
[EBIT(1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Ammortization] - Capital Expenditures + Δ Net Working Capital]
```

### MVA vs. EVA

* Market Value-Added: Excess of the market value of equity over its book value
* Book Value: Common equity on balance sheet
* Economic Valued-Added: Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) - Annual cost of capital
    * Or EBIT(1 - Tax Rate) - (Invested capital * % Cost of capital)
* You can also apply these to invidual divisions or assets

### Taxes

* Marginal tax rate: Tax rate on the next dollar you make
* Average tax rate: Total tax / total income
* Capital gain/loss: From assets (stocks, bonds, real estate)
    * Short-term (1 year) capital gains are taxed higher than long-term gains
* Dividends are taxed at 15%
* Alternative minimum tax: Different tax system for wealthy people

#### Corporate Taxes

* Interest income is taxed regularly
* 70% of dividend income is excluded (the rest is triple-taxed)
* Corporate taxes favor debt over equity financing
* Losses can be carried back 2 years or forward 20 years to offset taxes
* If you own 80% of another company's stock, you can consolidate your tax returns to offset taxes
* Depreciation rates are set by congress

## Analysis

You're trying to find something who's intrinsic value is much higher than its market value.

### Ratios

#### Liquidity

How able are you to pay off debts that mature in < 1 year?

* Current ratio: Current assets / Current liabilities
    * High numbers could mean excess inventory, aging accounts receivable, poor asset management
* Quick ratio (acid test): (Current assets - inventory) / current liabilities
    * Like the current ratio, but takes out inventory since it's so hard to liquidate

#### Asset management

How efficiently are you using your assets?

* Inventory turnover: Sales / Inventory
    * Lower means too much inventory
    * Inventory is a bad investment - no return!
* Days sales outstanding (average collection period): Accounts receivable / Average daily sales
    * How much daily sales are tied up in receivables?
    * Longer increases risk of bad debts
* Fixed assets turnover ratio: Sales / Net fixed assets
    * Do you have the right amount of fixed assets relative to your sales?
* Total assets turnover ratio: Sales / total assets
    * Are current assets being used efficiently? (Inventory, accounts receivable, etc.)
    * How much sales you getting by investing in assets?

#### Debt management

How where your assets were financed, and what long-term debt do you have?

* Total debt to total capital (debt ratio): Total debt / Total debt + equity
    * Higher means more risk to creditors
* Times interest earned (TIE): EBIT / Interest charges
    * How many times over can you pay your annual interest?

#### Profitability

How profitably do you use your assets?

* Return on equity: Net income / common equity
    * Stockholder's return on investment
    * The most important ratio
    * Easy to abuse
        * Doesn't consider risk
        * Doesn't consider amount of capital required
        * May encourage people to turn down profitable projects with a lower than average rate
        * Combine with risk and capital invested to get the shareholder value
* Operating margin: EBIT / Sales
    * Low margin means high operating costs
* Profit margin: Net income / Sales
    * Influenced by debt - Net income is after interest
* Return on assets: Net income / Total assets
    * How well are your assets being used?
* Return on invested capital: NOPAT / Total invested capital
    * Ignores assets
* Basic earning power: EBIT / Assets
    * Levels the playing field for firms with different debt/tax situations

#### Market value

What do investors think about your future prosepcts?

* Price/earnings ratio: Price per share / Earnings per share
    * High for strong growth, high risk
    * Low for slow growth, low risk
* Market / book ratio: Common equity / Shares outstanding

#### DuPont Equation

ROE = Profit margin * Total Asset Turnover * Equity Multiplier

How much do you earn from sales * How quickly do your turnover inventory * How leveraged are you?

### Assessing Performance

* Compare to industry averages
* Benchmark against competitors (better than average)
* Trends over time
* Be careful about comparing firms of different ages- depreciation and inflation are misleading
* Seasonal factors dramatically affect ratios
* "Window dressing": Deliberately manipulating ratios
* Is there one key customer, product, or supplier driving the numbers?
* Substantial overseas investment? Great opporunity, but risky.
* How much competition? Competition drives margins down.
* Do they have a strong R&D pipeline?
* Are there legal and regulatory hurdles?

## Time Value of Money

### Time Lines

```
0       5%       1       5%       2
|----------------|----------------|
`PV` = $100                         `FV` = ?
```

### Terms

`PV` = Present value, beginning amount
`FVₙ`= Future value after ₙ periods
`CFₜ`= Cash flow during a particular time period
`I`  = Interest rate (also r)
`N`  = Number of periods
`PMT`= Payment amount

Compounding Interest: `FVₙ` = `PV`(1 + `I`)ᴺ
Simple Interest: `PV` + `PV`(`I` * `N`)

Annuity: Equal payments over time, fixed # of periods. "Ordinary annuities" are due at the end of the period.
Perpetuity: An annuity that isn't over a fixed # of periods
Periodic Rate: Annual rate / periods
Bond: Series of annuity payments + a lump sum
Ammortized loan: Repaid in equal amounts

### Finding the present value

* Discounting is the opposite of compounding
* What current amount would be worth that in the future?

`PV` = `FVₙ` / (1 + `I`)ᴺ

Annuities/perpetuities:

`PV` = `PMT` / `I`

* "Payments" are even
* "Cash flows" are uneven

`PV` of a bond = `PV` of the annuity + `PV` of the lump sum

### Annual rates

* Advertised annual rate: Nominal, APR, Quoted, Stated
* Effective annual rate: Effective, EFF%, EAR
    * Produces the same future value with annual compounding
    * Higher than the APR if compounded more than once/year

Calculating fractional time periods:

`AMT` * (Periodic Rate)^Number of days

## Interest Rates

Factors affecting the cost of money:

* Production opportunities
* Time preferences for consumption (chance to make more now vs. later)
* Risk
* Inflation

When there are fewer creditors in a market, borrowers pay a higher interest rate.

Real rate of inflation = Interest rate - Inflation rate

`r*` = Risk-free, inflation-free interest rate. Based on the rate on treasury bonds.

Quoted interest rate = `r*` + Inflation Premium + Risk of Default + Liquidity + Maturity risk (volatility in the future)

Yield = Real risk-free rate + interest premium + maturity premium

Yield curves:

* Normal: Sloping up
* Abnormal: Sloping down
* Humped: Highest in the middle

### Pure expectations theory

* If the 2 year rate is `x` (eg. `1.05`)
* And the 1 year rate is `y`
* You should be able to estimate next year's interest rate:o

`y = 1 * 1.05 * 1 + x`

### Macroeconomic Factors

* Fed policy
* Budget deficit/surplus - Government either has to print money or demand more taxes
* International factors - Trade deficits must be financed
* Volume of business activity

### Business Decisions

* You might invest in longer-term debt to lock in an interest rate
* Long and short-term debt mitigates risk

## Bonds

Bonds are issued to raise debt capital. They require regular interest payments.

### Issuers

* Treasury bonds: Federal government, no default risk
* Corporate bonds: Risk and rates range
* Municipal bonds: Low default risk, exempt from taxes
* Foreign bonds: Some default risk

### Terms

* Par value: The amount borrowed, generally $1000
* Coupon rate: Yearly payment
    * They used to literally be mail-in coupons
    * Fixed or floating rates
    * If there's no coupon rate, then it sells for below par
* Maturity date: When will it be repaid? Usually 10 years.
* Call provisions: Allows borrower to pay back principal early
    * Usually has a penalty, usually 1 year of interest
    * Often has a deferral period where they can't
    * A "refunding operation" is similar to a home refinance
* Sinking fund: Company buys or calls % of bonds per year
    * Buy if interest rates have risen
    * Call if they dropped
* Convertible debt: Bonds exchangable for stock at a fixed price
* Warrants: Give bondholder option to buy stock a set price
* Put provisions: Allow holder to call debt early
* Income bond: No payments if the company made no money
* Indexed bond: Rate is anchored to the consumer price index

### Bond Valuations

* `rd` = Market interest rate (not coupon rate, although sometimes they are equal)
* `N` = Years to maturity
* `INT` = Dollars interest paid each year
* `M` = Maturity value (par)

Bond Value:

Sum of `t = 1` through `N`:

`INT / (1 + rd)^t` + `M / (1 + rd)^N`

If the going interest rate:

* Rises, bond is cheaper than par, and is a discount bond
* Falls, bond is more expensive than par, and is a premium bond
