[Visualizations that really work](https://hbr.org/2016/06/visualizations-that-really-work) - HBR

The two questions:

* Is the information conceptual (idea, simplification, teaching) or data-driven (statistics, informing, enlightening)?
* Am I declaring something (documenting, designing, affirming) or exploring something (prototyping, iterating, interacting, automating, confirming, discovering)?

```

## Idea Illustration

Showing processes or frameworks

* Keep the illustrations very simple

## Idea Generation

Tracking undefined or complex things. Loose whiteboarding. Helps facilitate group discussions.

## Visual Discovery

For big data, complex, or dynamic things.

* Is what I suspect actually true?
* What are some other ways of depicting this idea? (I may not know what I'm looking for yet)

## Everyday Dataviz

For simple, low-volume data. Line charts, bar charts, pies, and scatterplots.

* Communicate a single idea
