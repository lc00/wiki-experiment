It's not practical to directly change people's biases, but you can change the environment and data available for decision-making to mitigate the impact of them.

* Trainings need to be voluntary. Mandatory trainings make people resentful and reinforce bias.
* Testing candidates often encourages people to cherry-pick results, amplifying bias
* Performance reviews are easy to game, and only serve as a litigation shield
* Most formal grievance systems make things worse, since it makes people think that broken systems are working when they stop getting complaints

Things that work:

* Voluntary participation in college recruitment
* Formal mentoring programs (everyone thinks their mentees are special)
* Experience working toward the same goal as equals
* Self-managed teams
    * Many specialties still fall along stereotyped lines, cross-functional teams start to blur this
* Discussing hiring and promotion decisions openly

Hiring

* Same questions, same order every time, scored in real time
* Be very careful about job description language, it's very easy to bias
