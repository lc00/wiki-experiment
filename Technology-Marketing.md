* Tech products have a higher rate of failue (>50%) than non-technology products. Therefore, tech must execute basic marketing much better.
* 4-3-3 Rule: For investors, 4 products fail, 4 break even, 3 profit
* High-tech: Cutting-edge, replacing something. They share these characteristics:
    * Market uncertainty (FUD)
    * Technological uncertainty (Delays, support)
    * Competitive volatility (Convergence, product life-cycles)
    * "Unit 1" costs are very high (software, pharmaceuticals)
    * Vendor lock-in increases switching costs
* Crossing the chasm between early adopters and pragmatists is the biggest scaling challenge. Conserve cash early on in anticipation.
* Industry standards help push forward a dominant design (Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD)
* "Getting Amazoned": Sticking to the status quo and letting an unknown adapt
* "Marketing myopia": "That competitor doesn't matter"
* "Innovator's dilemma": Market leaders have a hard time innovating because they risk so much more
* "Creative destruction": Innovative products free up resources
* "Metcalfe's law": The effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users (network effects)
* "Base of the pyramid strategies": Targetting the 4 billion poorest people in the world
* "Founder's dillemma": Founders generally have to choose between making money or having power
* Establishing relationships is about trading favors
* The difference between a good and a service is that a service can't be resold
* A purchase is the only thing that actually generates revenue
* All needs have already been solved
* Perception trumps data
* "Tyranny of the served market": An overemphasis on existing customers. Need "bi-focal view" to see current and future customers.
* Organize around markets, not technology
* Bottom-lines ignore long-term
* Link your metrics to your strategy, and build dashboards around them
* "Are you the team that can get this done?"
* Are customers going to pay enough, fast enough to keep you going at poor economies of scale?
* Companies fail over customers, not products
* Customer development in addition to product development:
    * Personas
    * Look out for two-sided markets
    * Who is your beach-head market?
* You need to be 30% better on _some_ attribute.
* "Leap-frogging" (skipping a version)- this can prevent your ability to price skim
* Your supply chain: Supplier -> Manufacturer/OEM -> Channel members -> Customers

## Types of Marketing

* **Strategic**: Proactive, guides efforts in marketplace
* **Functional**: 4 P's, who will work on it
* **Tactical**: Advertisement, trade shows

### Strategic Market Planning

* Top-down (driven by CEO) or bottom-up (driven by business units)
* The goal is to gain competitive advantage- to have resources and competencies that are valuable, rare, durable, and difficult to imitate. Resources can be physical, intangible (patents, etc.). Competencies are bundles of skills. Your core competencies are those that are part of your competitive advantage.
* Durability - How fast are you obselete? Tech is generally not durable.
* Difficult to imitate - How hard are you to rip off?
* Firms overinvest in R&D, and underinvest in appropriated existing tech
* Strategy sweet spot is the intersection of Who? What Value? and How?
* Value propositions:
    * "All benefits": Easy, not reflective of a particular customer base
    * "Favorable differentiation": We're better than our competitors
    * "Resonating focus": Drive a point home to customers
    * Turn it into a tagline: _Name_ is a _type_ company, and with _product_, _customer_ gets _benefit_
    * Should be able to be pitched in 30 seconds

## The 4 P's

* **Product** - Development, partnerships
* **Price** - Cost, margins
* **Promotion** - Avertising and sales
* **Place** - Supply-chain, channels

## Innovation

* Can be incremental or break-through, but those are managed differently
* Technology push vs. Market pull
* Can be in the supply-chain: An innovation in manufacturing or delivery

## 3 Key Marketing Questions

* What customer needs are you addressing?
* Who are your customers and do they really care?
* Are they willing and able to pay your prices again and again?

Customers's needs are affected by

* Your existing competitors
* Potential new entrants
* Substitute products
* Suppliers

## Culture & Climate

* Culture: Deep-rooted values and beliefs, norms

## Markets vs. Industries

Should we be in this business? At what price?

Markets: buyers

* Is a market large enough to allow for multiple competitors?
* What's your short-term growth rate?
* What's your long-term growth rate?

Industries: sellers

* Easy or difficult to enter?
* Do suppliers have the power to set terms and conditions?
* Do buyers have the power to set terms and conditions?
* Easy or difficult for substitute products to steal marketshare?
* How fierce is competition?

Where are you positioned?

* Traditional position map
* Spider
* Matric
* BCG

SWOT analysis

Get to know markets and industries through research, primary and secondary.

Primary research:

* Determining strategy: Ask open-ended questions, use focus groups, walk in their shoes
* Determining tactics:  Ask close-ended question, "Which do you prefer?", surveys

## Market-Oriented & Cross-Functional Marketing

* Must excel at opportunity identification, product & process improvement, and product commercialization
* Same as customer-focused
* Using market information to guide strategic decision-making
* Intelligence generation -> Intelligence dissemination -> Intelligence integration -> Coordinated action

### Intelligence generation

* Purchase secondary market intelligence
* Expressed needs aren't everything
* Marketing myopia, the tyranny of the served market
* Responsive vs. proactive market orientation
    * "Market-driving" is a subset of this
* "Bifocal vision"- Present & future customers

### Intelligence dissemination

* Boundary-less organization
* Meetings, conferences, newsletters, databases, hall talk
* Prevent hoarding

### Intelligence Integration

* Explicit vs. tacit knowledge
* Knowledge management

### Coordinated Action

* If someone was a part of a decision, they're more committed to applying it
* "Coopetition": Competing for scarce resources

Facilitating conditions:

* Prioritize information gathering
* Top management commitment
* Decentralized org. structure
* Market-based compensation

### Product Development & Marketing - R&D Interaction

* Marketing is boundary-spanning
* Cross-functional product-dev
* Need communication, use of information, conflict management
* Team-orientation
* Reward systems - Team & group
* Breakthrough vs. incremental innovations
* Know your customer, use to resolve early questions
* "Cooptation": Informal collaboration & consensus-building
* Cooperation- colocate and embed

Teams must have:

* Commitment of senior management
* Clear and stable vision
* Improvisation
* Information exchange
* Collaboration under pressure

Barriers:

* Dominant engineering culture
* Different values, education, personalities
* Different locations
* Rivalry

### Business Models

Pick one:

* Consulting
* Content provider
* Installation & maintenance
* Manufacturer
* Research & technology

### Revenue Model

* Regular Recurring
* One-time

### Decision-making Units

* Who buys, who uses, who might be the champion
    * Champion: Who wants the customer to purchase
    * By an ally to your champion, not a salesperson
* Consumer products vs. commercial products
* National infrastructure
* Primary economic buyer: who controls the budget
* Primary, secondary influencers: Magazines & the dumb buddy
* Who has veto power?
* Purchasing departments
* Learn about the DMUs for your personas

### Total Addressable Market

* An estimate of the market size- amount of annual revenue if you got 100% market share
* Find the "beachhead market" to make your way in
* "Count noses," look at trends- how much will each spend per year?
* A $5M TAM is too small, $20M-$100M is good, >$1B is bad

### Lifecycle Use Cases

* How, why, when, where your product is used
* How does the customer use, service, and dispose of your product?
* Resistance and barriers to adoption
* Should all be from the customer's view
* Should be a visual

### Pain Points

* Are you solving a pain point, or introducing a new one?
* Is your product enough to change customer behavior? If possible, rely on their existing behavior.

## Market Research

Gathering information:

* Market research is between 0.1% and 0.8% of revenue and uses between 5 and 50 people
* Standard methods are good for incremental innovation, otherwise intuition drives breakthroughs. In between those, check in with your customers, use prototypes, and tap into your "lead users"

### Tools

* Concept testing
* Conjoint analysis (breaking a product into value per feature)
* Customer visits with a cross-functional team
* Empathetic design: getting inside a user's world, finding pain points, offering customizations
* Finding "lead users"
* Quality function deployment
    * Map customer needs into design requirements
    * Kano model
* Prototyping
* Beta testing
* Customer-driven innovation- open source, modding
* Biomimicry

### Forecasting

Qualitative tools:

* Delphi Method: Separate experts, look for consensus
* Analagous data

Quantitative tools:

* Bass model (S-curve)

| Incremental           | Breakthrough     |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Time-series           | Delphi technique |
| Moving average        | Analagous data   |
| Exponential smoothing | Bass model       |

## Understanding High-Tech Customers

### The Customer Purchase Decision Process

1. Problem Recognition
2. Information Search
3. Evaluate Alternatives
4. Purchase Decision
5. Post-purchase Evaluation

Design:

* Functional + Aesthetics
* Design thinking: Human + business + technology factors

Factors affecting the adoption of innovation

* Relative advantage
* Compatibility
* Complexity
* Trialability
* Ability to communicate product benefits
* Observability

Tech adopters:

Innovators | Early Adopters | The Chasm | Early Majority | Late Majority | Laggards

To cross the chasm:

1. Choose a "beach head" customer
    * They should have a single "must-have" reason to buy
    * They should be adjacent to related segments:
        * Adjacent areas have word-of-mouth
        * Similar needs
        * Capturable in a short period of time
2. Develop the "whole product"
3. Have competition, and be better than them 
4. Enter the "bowling alley" - your beachhead customer should be the lead pin that helps you capture other niche markets. This is easy to skip, but these are the alliances you'll need to go mass-market.
5. Enter the "tornado." The current market leader will propelled into a tornado by the pragmatist buyers who fight to choose a "winner," and companies will show triple-digit growth. There is typically one winner, one smaller player, and everyone else takes scraps. Market leaders here tend to stay the market leaders, unless they do something like fail to keep up with falling price points or forcing the market to adopt an innovation they don't want. This transition is hard because the bowling alley and the tornado require opposite strategies. The bowling alley is won by references, customization, and niche positioning. The tornado is won by mass markets, increased distribution, generic products, attacking the competition, and commoditizing your product.
6. Enter "main street." There are no new customers, so you sell customization and target niches again.

### Segmentation, targeting, and positioning

* Divide possible customers into groups
* A "vertical" is an industry
* A "horizontal" is a function
* Profile your customers
* Evaluate and select a target market based on:
    * Size
    * Growth
    * Level of competition
    * Your capability to serve this segment
* Position your product within the segment (based on perception and competition)
* Multi-attribute model: customer ranks importance of performance on attributes
* Perceptual map

### The Customer Paradoxical Relationship

Positive benefits of a technology may be outweighed by their negative consequences. Eg. ATMs at banks hurt relationships between customers and tellers.

* Control vs. chaos
* Assimilation vs. isolation
* Intelligence vs. stupidity
* Freedom vs. enslavement
* Engagement vs. disengagement
* Efficiency vs. inefficiency
* Fulfilling needs vs. creating needs
* New vs. obselete

Customer attitudes toward technology:

* Techtopian
* "Work machine"
* Green/luddite
* Techspressive

## Venture Metrics

Cash is king!

* Breakeven volume
* Burn rate (rate at which you spend cash)
* Cost of acquiring new customers
* Gross margin
* Lifetime value of a customer
* Net margin
* Next product purchase rate
* Product cost
* Retention rate
* Sales, admin, R&D, and legal (SARL)
* Time to cash out (how soon you will run out of cash)
* Time to cash-flow positive (when investors start getting paid)

## Pro-Formas

Model the first 12-24 months, then do quarterly for years 3 and 4. Model for different scenarios.

* P&L, Balance Sheet, and Statement of Cash Flows
* EBITDA approximates cash flow
* Target numbers: Top-down guess, based on experience (+/- 20%)
* Forecast numbers: Supported by analysis (+/- 10%)
* Planning numbers: Bottom-up commitments (+/- 5%)
* Use real numbers, not conservative guesses

## Revenue Projections

You need to forecast revenues:

* Per product/service
* Over 3-5 years of time
* Including # of units and average net price/unit

Use net units and prices. Time 0 = when you start the clock.

## Target Costing

If you can't cover your costs, you're out of business. The cost is locked in at the design stage, so work backward to establish a target cost.

* Accounting costs
* Societal costs
* Fixed costs
* Variable costs
* Direct vs. indirect costs
* Total costs = fixed + variable costs
* Dock price
* Markup is added to cost to get pricce
* Margin is percentage that price exceeds cost
* Net margin uses total costs
* Gross margin = Revenue - COGS
    * COGS = Direct material + direct labor + manufacturing overhead
    * Tech companies should shoot for >50% gross margin
    * Services use "cost of services rendered"
* Breakeven volume = $0 profit

Steps to target costing:

1. Start w/ price and estimate of sales #s
2. Backtrack through distribution channel to dock price
3. Include required profits
4. Target costs = forecasted revenues - target profits
5. Allocate target costs by department
6. Reality check, reiterate
7. Use these as budgets
