* Tech products have a higher rate of failue (>50%) than non-technology products. Therefore, tech must execute basic marketing much better.
* 4-3-3 Rule: For investors, 4 products fail, 4 break even, 3 profit
* High-tech: Cutting-edge, replacing something. They share these characteristics:
    * Market uncertainty (FUD)
    * Technological uncertainty (Delays, support)
    * Competitive volatility (Convergence, product life-cycles)
    * "Unit 1" costs are very high (software, pharmaceuticals)
    * Vendor lock-in increases switching costs
* Crossing the chasm between early adopters and pragmatists is the biggest scaling challenge. Conserve cash early on in anticipation.
* Industry standards help push forward a dominant design (Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD)
* "Getting Amazoned": Sticking to the status quo and letting an unknown adapt
* "Marketing myopia": "That competitor doesn't matter"
* "Innovator's dilemma": Market leaders have a hard time innovating because they risk so much more
* "Creative destruction": Innovative products free up resources
* "Metcalfe's law": The effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users (network effects)
* "Base of the pyramid strategies": Targetting the 4 billion poorest people in the world
* "Founder's dillemma": Founders generally have to choose between making money or having power
* Establishing relationships is about trading favors
* The difference between a good and a service is that a service can't be resold
* A purchase is the only thing that actually generates revenue
* All needs have already been solved
* Perception trumps data
* "Tyranny of the served market": An overemphasis on existing customers. Need "bi-focal view" to see current and future customers.
* Organize around markets, not technology
* Bottom-lines ignore long-term
* Link your metrics to your strategy, and build dashboards around them
* "Are you the team that can get this done?"
* Are customers going to pay enough, fast enough to keep you going at poor economies of scale?
* Companies fail over customers, not products
* Customer development in addition to product development:
    * Personas
    * Look out for two-sided markets
    * Who is your beach-head market?
* You need to be 30% better on _some_ attribute.

## Types of Marketing

* **Strategic**: Proactive, guides efforts in marketplace
* **Functional**: 4 P's, who will work on it
* **Tactical**: Advertisement, trade shows

### Strategic Market Planning

* Top-down (driven by CEO) or bottom-up (driven by business units)
* The goal is to gain competitive advantage- to have resources and competencies that are valuable, rare, durable, and difficult to imitate. Resources can be physical, intangible (patents, etc.). Competencies are bundles of skills. Your core competencies are those that are part of your competitive advantage.
* Durability - How fast are you obselete? Tech is generally not durable.
* Difficult to imitate - How hard are you to rip off?
* Firms overinvest in R&D, and underinvest in appropriated existing tech
* Strategy sweet spot is the intersection of Who? What Value? and How?
* Value propositions:
    * "All benefits": Easy, not reflective of a particular customer base
    * "Favorable differentiation": We're better than our competitors
    * "Resonating focus": Drive a point home to customers
    * Turn it into a tagline: _Name_ is a _type_ company, and with _product_, _customer_ gets _benefit_
    * Should be able to be pitched in 30 seconds

## The 4 P's

* **Product** - Development, partnerships
* **Price** - Cost, margins
* **Promotion** - Avertising and sales
* **Place** - Supply-chain, channels

## Innovation

* Can be incremental or break-through, but those are managed differently
* Technology push vs. Market pull
* Can be in the supply-chain: An innovation in manufacturing or delivery

## 3 Key Marketing Questions

* What customer needs are you addressing?
* Who are your customers and do they really care?
* Are they willing and able to pay your prices again and again?

Tech companies often have to blend and innovate strategies. Allow for emergent design from low levels, and combine it with your planned design.
