## Causes

* *Exhaustion*: Always-on cultures, time pressure, and having too much work to do
* *Cynicism*: Overload, high conflict, unfairness, lack of participation in decisions
* *Inefficacy*: Lack of resources (time, information), and support (autonomy, relationships)

## Recovery and Prevention

* Prioritize Self-Care
    * Document how you spend your time. Identify how you feel during each activity, and how important it is that _you_ be the one to do it.
    * Figure out what fills you up
* Shift Your Perspective
    * Figure what is and isn't in your control
    * Is it time to move on?
    * What do you need to give up to make this fun?
* Reduce Exposure To Stressors
    * Practice saying no
* Seek Out Connections
    * Coaches and mentors
    * Volunteering can give you perspective
