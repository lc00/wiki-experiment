## Notes

* Keep your best activities, name them, and repeat them often

## Rethinking Practice

### Encode Success

* Practice makes permanent
* Don't make failure likely in an attempt to increase rigor- they need to gradual succeed and make incremental corrections
* Supervise closely enough to catch bad habits- Design activities so that it's reasonable to catch and remediate error
* Failure builds character, but not skills

### Practice the 20%

* Practice the parts with the highest impact
* Use data to uncover _what_ the 20% is
* The value of practice _increases_ after mastery
    * The 20% impact skills are the ones you want the most automaticity with- be great at the most important thing

### Let the Mind Follow the Body

* Practice a skill to automaticity
* Make a habit of a skill through practice- you don't have to be aware of your knowledge to use it
* Moving from conscious to unconscious allows you to use your active cognition on new things

### Unlock Creativity... with Repetition

* Automate more things to enable creativity
* You need to drill skills and memorize facts in order to engage in higher-order thinking
* Once they've practiced enough to understand what they're doing, have them reflect

### Replace Your Purpose (with an Objective)

* A purpose is something you want to work on, but an objective is measurable
* Champion teachers spend most of their time on the objective
* Give it a number and a target

### Practice "Bright Spots"

* Spend more time practicing strengths than mitigating weaknesses
* Find ways to use strong skills in new settings
* Use student strengths as a model for other students

### Differentiate Drill from Scrimmage

* Drills deliberately distort the setting to focus on a specific skill
* Drills increase the density of repetition and help encode success
* A scrimmage is designed to replicate the complexity and uncertainty of the full game
* Both are important, but drills are better at building skill and scrimmages are better for evaluation

### Correct Instead of Critique

* Critique doesn't build habit, only going back and doing it again corrrectly does
* Neurons have no sense of time- doing it wrong once and right once doesn't actually fix it, you need to correct multiple times
* Try to correct in private- if you do it in public, make it clear that this is a common error and have everyone repeat it

## How To Practice

### Analyze The Game

* Identify top performers and analyze top performance
* Break down skills, understand the role they play, prioritize, and rank them
* Describe those skills for others who want to replicate them

### Isolate The Skill

* Break down learning into bite-size chunks
* Don't practice writing books while holding the pencil the wrong way
* Look for people compensating for lacking a fundamental skill

### Name It

* Name your key skills to give your team a common language
* Monitor usage of the names to ensure consistent and correct usage

### Integrate the Skills

* Game-like scenarios: isolate some realistic section of the game
* Matching: Choosing the correct in
