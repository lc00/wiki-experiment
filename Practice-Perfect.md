## Notes

* Keep your best activities, name them, and repeat them often

## Rethinking Practice

### Encode Success

* Practice makes permanent
* Don't make failure likely in an attempt to increase rigor- they need to gradual succeed and make incremental corrections
* Supervise closely enough to catch bad habits- Design activities so that it's reasonable to catch and remediate error
* Failure builds character, but not skills

### Practice the 20%

* Practice the parts with the highest impact
* Use data to uncover _what_ the 20% is
* The value of practice _increases_ after mastery
    * The 20% impact skills are the ones you want the most automaticity with- be great at the most important thing

### Let the Mind Follow the Body

* Practice a skill to automaticity
* Make a habit of a skill through practice- you don't have to be aware of your knowledge to use it
* Moving from conscious to unconscious allows you to use your active cognition on new things

### Unlock Creativity... with Repetition

* Automate more things to enable creativity
* You need to drill skills and memorize facts in order to engage in higher-order thinking
* Once they've practiced enough to understand what they're doing, have them reflect

### Replace Your Purpose (with an Objective)

* A purpose is something you want to work on, but an objective is measurable
* Champion teachers spend most of their time on the objective
* Give it a number and a target

### Practice "Bright Spots"

* Spend more time practicing strengths than mitigating weaknesses
* Find ways to use strong skills in new settings
* Use student strengths as a model for other students

### Differentiate Drill from Scrimmage

* Drills deliberately distort the setting to focus on a specific skill
* Drills increase the density of repetition and help encode success
* A scrimmage is designed to replicate the complexity and uncertainty of the full game
* Both are important, but drills are better at building skill and scrimmages are better for evaluation

### Correct Instead of Critique

* Critique doesn't build habit, only going back and doing it again corrrectly does
* Neurons have no sense of time- doing it wrong once and right once doesn't actually fix it, you need to correct multiple times
* Try to correct in private- if you do it in public, make it clear that this is a common error and have everyone repeat it

## How To Practice

### Analyze The Game

* Identify top performers and analyze top performance
* Break down skills, understand the role they play, prioritize, and rank them
* Describe those skills for others who want to replicate them

### Isolate The Skill

* Break down learning into bite-size chunks
* Don't practice writing books while holding the pencil the wrong way
* Look for people compensating for lacking a fundamental skill

### Name It

* Name your key skills to give your team a common language
* Monitor usage of the names to ensure consistent and correct usage

### Integrate the Skills

* Game-like scenarios: Isolate some realistic section of the game
* Matching: Choosing the correct (least invasive) tool given several options
* Game environment: Practice in the same environment the game is played in

### Make a Plan

* What do you need to practice? Use data
* Plan each minute
* Rehearse and revise the plan- spend more time planning the practice than you do actually practicing
* Record and reflect on practice

### Make Each Minute Matter

* Use strong signals ("clap once if you can hear me") to bring people together, not narrative
* Use timers for breaks
* Have "back of the pocket" activities
* Have different ways to combine people quickly (attendance numbers)
* Name your drills
* Use self-interrupts to cut people off

## Using Modeling

### Model _and_ Describe

* Describe for the learner in no uncertain terms what the skill involves, what it looks like, and how to do it
* Modeling helps them replicate, description helps them understand

### Call Your Shots

* When modeling, be explicit about what you're doing
* Tell people what to watch for

### Make Models Believable

* It takes away excuses for not learning
* Keep the context as close as possible to how learners perform
* In-person is more believable than video

### Try Supermodeling

* Staff / professional development meetings are an opportunity to model the techniques you want to see
* Model any other skills you want the learner to develop

### Insist They "Walk _This_ Way"

* The learner should replicate it exactly
* Don't let them put their own spin on it

### Model Skinny Parts

* Don't model too many steps at once before letting them practice
* Stay on the part until they can do it with the prompt only

### Model the Path

* When modeling, make sure learners know the work that _led_ to the end result
* Model the major steps and imperfections that lead to greatness

### Get Ready for Your Close-up

* Use video as a model
* Enables rewatches, slow-downs, etc.

## Feedback

### Practice _Using_ Feedback (Not Just Getting It)

* People get very practiced at ignoring or deflecting feedback
* You need to become coachable
* Force yourself out of autopilot
* Try for a few minutes, get 1 postive / 1 delta feedback, go back and try again
* Lots of quick at-bats applying feedback
* You need a tight loop to see whether the feedback works

### Apply First, Then Reflect

* Don't analyze the feedback first- try applying it
* People often use earnest conversation and reflection as a way to avoid practice
    * "Whose turn is it?" can interrupt this
* The practice cycle is:
    1. Practice
    1. Feedback
    1. Do over with the feedback
    1. Repeat
    1. Reflect
* What people usually do is:
    1. Practice
    1. Feedback
    1. Reflect and discuss
    1. Possibly do over

### Shorten the Feedback Loop

* Short, imperfect, frequent feedback is more effective than in-depth feedback later on
* Have them practice in their head first

### Use the Power of Positive

* Focusing on improving your strengths
* Positive coaching tools:
    1. Statement of identification - What did they do right?
    1. Statement of application - Apply their skill in a new way
    1. Statement of replication - Help them do it again

### Limit Yourself

* Don't give all of the feedback you could possibly give - 1 or 2 things only
* If they're getting feedback from multiple sources, use a tracker to make sure that the feedback isn't overwhelming

### Make It an Everyday Thing

* Feedback shouldn't just be linked to mistakes, make it normal
* Use sentence starters:
    * "One thing I thought was really effective was..."
    * "What if you tried..."

### Describe the Solution (Not the Problem)

* Tell people what you want them to do and why, not what you want them to stop doing
* Develop abbreviated ways of saying them so you can do them quickly

### Lock It In

* People don't always apply feedback correctly
* Tools:
    1. Summarize Feedback - Have them summarize and repeat back to you. "Let's both check our understanding here"
    1. Prioritize Feedback - Have them identify and commitment to the two most important things
    1. Next Action - Have them identify the next thing they're going to do

## Culture of Practice

* Culture is the things that people take for granted in an organization
* Is your classroom set up for practice or observation?

### Normalize Error

* If you don't fall, you aren't trying hard enough. Do the things you're afraid of.
* Failure rate and level of skill are independent of each other
* Work on fixing errors before they become too ingrained
* "Get past nice" and don't apologize for correcting someone

### Break Down the Barriers to Practice

* People will look for ways to avoid practice because it's scary to feel dumb, so they'll put up barriers to doing the work- "I don't believe in...", "This isn't realistic...", "We're working on something else..."
* Being on topic and being on task are not the same thing
* Name the barriers call them out
* Break down tough students by practicing with them one one one until their demeanor changes

### Make It Fun to Practice

* Make games and competitions out of the boring parts
* Make sure to maintain the objective
* The team should cheer for people in practice, not just at the game

### Everybody Does It

* Don't let leaders observe other people take risks
* If you're nervous about not doing a perfect model, tell them you're going to model a B+ version and use it as an opportunity to model the feedback process
* Show people that you're willing to take risks too
* Shift the language from "Any volunteers?" to "Who's going to try first?" or "Who wants in?"

### Leverage Peer-to-Peer Accountability

* Make people accountable to each other, not to a big, anonymous organization
* A "school teacher" is preferable to a "classroom teacher"
* "Together, we are all the teachers of the students of this school"

### Hire for Practice

* Have teachers teach a sample lesson, and gauge how they respond to, and incorporate feedback
* Have them teach again to the instructors, incorporating their feedback
* Assume you're hiring people for at least 5 years
* Are they receptive to feedback from a subordinate?
* Hire for the things that don't improve through practice

### Praise the Work

* Praise actions, not traits- traits aren't in a student's control
* Thank people for behavior that meets expectations- praise people for behavior that exceeds it
* It needs to be public and genuine

## Post-Practice: Making New Skills Stick

Drive-by trainings don't work.

### Look for the Right Things

* If you want to get something done, measure it. Easiest way to measure is to observe.
* Tell the instructor what you'll be observing for ahead of time
* Can be done with video
* Ask students to set their own goals

### Coach During the Game (Don't Teach)

* You can't learn and perform at the same time- you remind people of what they've already learned during the game
* Remind people with signals and short reminders
* You can do real-time coaching in the classroom- in-ear devices?

### Keep Talking

* Name the skills and call them out as shorthand
* Reduce the transaction cost for an idea (and build culture)

### Walk the Line (Between Support and Demand)

* Be transparent about your role as an evaluator
* You need to balance being supportive with demanding excellence, and consequences for not meeting the standard
* Echo the mission of the organization
* It's not advice- it's required to improve performance

### Measure Success

* Measure 2 things:
    * The effectiveness of your practice
    * Whether you are practicing the right things
* Instead of looking at a lesson purely subjectively, look at it as a series of data points
* Use multiple methods to gather the data- self-report, observation, performance metrics)

## Monday Morning

These are the techniques that are the easiest to remember and implement immediately:

* Practice the 20 - What are the highest impact skills?
* Isolate the skill - How can you isolate a skill to be practiced?
* Name it - Name your most important skills
* Call your shots - Tell the team what you're working on
