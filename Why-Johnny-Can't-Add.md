## Traditional Curriculum

Sequence:

* Grades 1-6 are arithmetic
* Grades 7-8 are algebra and light geometry
* Grade 9 is algebra
* Grade 10 is deductive geometry
* Grade 11 is intermediate algebra and trigonometry
* Grade 12 is solid geometry and advanced algebra

Criticisms:

* These are mechanical processes which rely on memorization rather than understanding
* The processes are disconnected
* Geometry seems like a big jump because its style of reasoning is so different. Because it's such a jump, students just end up memorizing the proof.
* A connection is never made to proofs in geometry and proofs in algebra
* The traditional curriculum respects tradition too much- triangles are not necessary when there aren't as many prospective surveyors
* It's cold and abstract, so what motivation does anyone have to learn it? The rewards are too far in the future, "to get into college" makes college sound bad, and not everyone will be a professional mathmatician, scientist, or engineer.
* Technical language, symbolism, and abstract concepts obscure the reasoning. You can use social or legal problems, like differentiating between "all good cars are expensive but not all expensive cars are good." That's easier to grasp than "All parallelograms are quadrilaterals, but not all quadrilaterals are parallelograms."
* These don't capture the beauty of mathematics. Subjects are not selected for their beauty, and adding fractions isn't beautiful. Learning French grammar doesn't capture the beauty of French literature.
* Some students are attracted by the intellectual challenge (or because they like things they just happen to do well), but this is rare, and cold comfort to people who just find it confusing and arbitrary
* If the applications are just as boring and disconnected as the theory, in what sense are they applications?
* This is like requiring students to read musical notation without allowing them to play music
* Thousands of textbooks have been published on the traditional math curriculum, the vary only in order of topics. They include low-value topics that help them sell the books better.

If what you're really teaching is thinking and not memorization, what could a student steal from an open book exam?

## The Origin of the Modern Mathematics Movement

* In the early 50's, there was widespread agreement that math education had been unsuccessful- low grades, low adult retention, low student interest
* Driven by the space race, some math researchers tried to make a new math curriculum
* They assumed the problem was that math was too old, students knew this, and therefore deduced that it was irrelevant
* The proposed solution was the to teach newer forms of mathematics- abstract algebra, topology, symbolic logic, set theory, and boolean algebra

Some criteria one could evaluate the new mathematics on:

* Is it correct? Useless, doesn't address how students will take to it
* Will it develop mathematicians? This wouldn't be appropriate given the disproportionate number of students that will become mathematicians
* The contents should contribute to the goals of school and be accessible to young people

Reform of mathematics education was necessary, but it's not clear that curriculum was the most important thing to tackle first. That effort might have been better spent on making better teachers, who in turn may have contributed to making a better curriculum.

## The deductive approach to mathematics

Familiarity breeds uncriticalness

* Since most students were learning by rote memorization, the new math proposed teaching logically, one step at a time
* Commutative and associative properties are taught as ways to understand arithmetic, positive and negative integers
* Some compromises have to be made because some subjects are too academic (irrational numbers, roots)
* Axioms are things that are held as self-evident theorems are built with them
* Many of these things tooks hundreds of years to gain acceptance- irrational numbers, 0, negative numbers, complex numbers. A lot of the work that was done with them was intuited, bumbled through, or just wrong
* The use of letters to represent a class of numbers (eg. .`ax + b`, where `a` and `b` represent any real number) leads to general expressions that are true for any value of those numbers
* Many early cultures used words instead of variables
* Most of the greatest advancements in math were intuited, not deduced. The logic always came later.
* You need to go through the same challenges as your ancestors, and experience the same conclusions to think at the same level they did. An educator can accelerate this.
* You can't get someone to think scientifically by pretending all of the bumbling didn't happen, giving them neat and clean results. This ignores history.
* Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them
* "I have my result, but I don't know how to prove it yet"

## Quotes

> A few students are attracted to mathematics by the intellectual challenge or because they like what they happen to do well. The rare student who experiences this challenge may indeed be intrigued - as some mathematicians are - by the fact that there are only five regular polyhedra. However, as far as most students are concerned, the world would be just as well off if there were an inifinite number of them. As a matter of fact, there is an infinite number of regular polygons and no one seems depressed by this fact.

> Textbook writers also seem to take inordinate pride in brevity, which can often be interpreted as incomprehensibility. Reasons for steps are either not given or given so briefly as to make the presentation almost useless to the student. Many authors seem to be saying, "I have learned this material and now I defy you to learn it." Brevity in mathematical exposition is the soul of witlessness and obscurity.

> Reform of mathematics education was called for, but there is a serious question as to whether curriculum was the weakest component and should have been tackled first. It would, I believe, be generally conceded that the policy of universal education pursued in the United States is highly commendable, but our country was not and still is not prepared to carry on such a .program. Certainly we do not have enough qualified teachers; therefore the education in many parts of this country is woefully weak. Were more good teachers available they wou1d have been able long ago, by acting in concert, to remedy the defects of the traditional curriculum. Since the teacher is at least as important as the curriculum, the money, time and energy devoted to curriculum reform might well have been devoted to the improvement of teachers.

> If it took mathematicians a thousand years from the time first-class mathematics appeared to arrive at the concept of negative numbers - and it did - and if it took another thousand years for mathematicians to accept negative numbers - as it did - we may be sure that students will have difficulties with negative numbers. Moreover, the students will have to master these difficulties in about the same way that the mathematicians did, by gradually accustoming themselves to the new concepts, by working with them and by taking advantage of all the intuitive support that the teacher can muster.

> One could of course argue that the growth of mathematics may indeed have proceeded as just described, but now that we have the proper logical structures for the number system, the calculus and other branches, we need not ask the students to repeat the fumblings of the masters. We can give students the correct approaches and they will understand them. This argument can be countered by the fact that the greatest mathematicians did try to build the logical foundations for the various subjects buf failed for centuries to do so. Their failure should serve as some evidence that the logical approaches are not easy to grasp. One can compress history and avoid many of the wasted efforts and pitfalls, but one caunot eliminate it. Of course, our students may be superior to the best mathematicians of the past.

> Most proofs presented to students are also artificial for additiona1 reasons. When a mathematician seeks to prove a theorem he suspects is correct, he uses any means, however clumsy, indirect or devious, but perhaps more natural to the creative process, to make the proof. Once the theorem is proven he or his successors, now able to see how the essential difficulty was overcome, can usually devise a smoother or more direct proof. Some theorems have been reproven several times, each successive proof remodeling and simplifying the previous one and often including generalizations or stronger results. Thus, the final theorem and proof are far from the original natural thoughts. One should expect, then, that the student facing such a reworked, polished, and possibly more complicated resu1t would not be able to grasp it.

> The insistence on a logical approach also deceives the student in another way. He is led to believe that mathematics is created by geniuses who start with axioms and reason directly from the axioms to the theorems. The student, unable to function in this manner, feels humbled and baffled but the obliging teacher is fully prepared to demonstrate genius in action. It is intellectually dishonest to teach the deductive approach as though the results were acquired by logic.

> Asking the students to cite axioms in the elementary operations with numbers is like asking an adult to justify each action he takes after getting up in the morning. Why should he bathe? Why should he brush his teeth? Why wear clothes? And so on. If a man should consciously consider and answer these questions he would never get to work. Most of what he does in the morning must be habitual. There is a story that a centipede was walking along leisurely when it met a toad. The toad remarked to the centipede, "Isn't it wonderful? You have one hundred feet and yet you know when to use each one". Thereupon the centipede began to think about which foot to use next and was unable to move.

> The mathematician says A, writes B, means C, but D is what it should be. And D is in fact a splendid idea which emerges from tidying up the mess.

> The deductive structures which many mathematicians like to call mathematics are tbe dried-up stalks of the living plants. They are empty formalisms as opposed to real contents; they are shells of palaces.

> Another argument advanced by the advocates of the new mathematics is that their emphasis on logical structure teaches students to think deductively. This is probably correct. But even if they do teach deductive logic, why is this so important? It is not the kind of thinking that is useful in everyday life. The big problems and even the little ones that human beings are called upon to solve in life cannot be solved deductively. There are no self-evident axioms from which one can deduce what career to follow, whom to marry, or even whether to go to the movies. The real decisions call for judgment, and this is entirely difierent from deductive reasoning which leaves no room for judgment. The legal mind, the business mind, and the political mind are much more relevant.

Descartes:

> I found that, as for Logic, its syllogisms and the majority of its other precepts are useful rather in the communication of what we already know or... in speaking without judgment about things of which one is ignorant, than in the investigation of the unknown
