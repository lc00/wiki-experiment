    * Fear <-- High Performance --> Boredom
    * People need challenge, support, and recognition
* Validate people, normalize empathy

    * Schedule times for things
    * Quiet your lower brain with simple tasks
* Dopamine activates learning centers
* A question is less combative and more supportive than a statement

* Mindfulness is not getting lost in your own storyline
* Self-criticism keeps us socially safe
* Matter doesn't change history, belief does. External reality is not a prison. We are not the victims of the world, we are its co-creators. The _spiritual_ world is reality.
* Spiritual journeys are inward, not out and abstract.
* Don't deprive others of their identities. This comes from insecurity.
* Life isn't fundamentally hostile, or a battleground. It can be cooperative.

## Human Performance Pyramid

Energy is the capacity to do work.

|      | Capacity  | Refreshed By |
| ---- | --------- | ------------ |
| Peak | Spiritual | Reflection   |
|      | Mental    | Meditation   |
|      | Emotional | Relaxation & warm relations |
| Base | Physical  | Exercise & Rest |

## Results

A result is a function of internal and external factors.

* External - "Not my fault" vs. "I'm responsible for my choices"
* Internal - "I'm impotent" vs. "I can influence outcomes"

| Victim Stance | Generative Stance |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| "What happened to you?" | "What challenge did you face?" |
| "Who wronged you?" | "How did you choose to respond?" |
| "How did they hurt you?" | "What are the consequences of your choices" |
| "What should they have done?" | "Could you have done something more effective? Could you do something now?" |
| "What punishment do they deserve?" | "What lessons can you take away?" |

## Ego

Your ego is always trying to keep you safe, it's just not always very effective. Treat yourself the way you would treat someone you care about.

Your self-worth is the determinant of your well-being. If you get yours from being special or above-average, you're on shakey ground.

"I can and should be different than I am"

* Can you pin your self-worth to that? No.
* You're fighting yourself, which engages your ego sentry
* Shunning an undesireable quality keeps you from growing

Serves these functions:

* Executive
* Sentry
* Mediator
* Maintains your patterns
* Sense of self
* Symbol

The difference between a level 4 and a level 5 manager is a mature ego.

| Bad Ego | Good Ego |
| ------- | -------- |
| Knower / judger | Observer / learner |
| Defensive routines | Defects are treasures |
| Fears being wrong | Acknowledges ignorance |
| | Self-esteem is rooted in the long-term |

## Culture

Culture is an organizational glue. It's a primary source of conflict in relationships. Limits the range of what's possible. It's the most enduring part of an organization, and the thing that's the most difficult to change. It's why new ideas have a hard time winning. Destroying unhealthy cultures is just as important as creating healthy ones. A leader's daily action embeds culture- what they pay attention to, what their reactions are, and what their perceived criteria for success are. Culture is a filter on information coming in. The past got you to where you are. Culture is the shared assumptions (beliefs) that a group of people learned worked in the past and are taught to new members (the "rules for success"). Leadership is the creation, management, and destruction of culture. Your mood is contagious- you set the culture with your attitude. People mirror each other.

### Culture Styles

| Style | What it's about | Where it comes from | Who manages it |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------- | --- |
| Control | Power | Military | Structure |
| Collaboration | Affiliation | Sports | Integrator |
| Competence | Achievement | College | Excellor |
| Cultivation | Growth | Religion | Developer |

### Culture Types

1. Generative
    * Moving from indepence to interdependence requires self-referenced egos
1. Sustainable
1. Disfunctional
1. Toxic - "I will destroy you"

### Levels of Culture

1. Artifacts (visible structures & processes)
1. Espoused values
1. Underlying assumptions

### Growing a Culture

1. Identify the gap between the present and the vision
1. Surface the beliefs that create that gap
1. Create opportunities to grow in new ways
1. Make learning visible
1. Consolidate and integrate the old and new

## Learning

A plan is just a tool, not a commitment. A change isn't complete until it becomes a part of your self-concept (for yourself and how others view you).

Learning happens through failure- defensive reasoning blocks learning, and criticizing the outside protects your ego.

Your ego's fear-based, defensive goals are:

* Remain in unilateral control
* Maximize wins and suppress losses
* Supress negative feelings
* Be rational - Define and achieve goals

1. What do I want to achieve?
1. How will I know when I get there?
1. Plan-Do-Check-Act

## Conversations

3 levels to every conversation:

1. *Task* - 
    * Victim stance can either improve or hurt this, generative stance improves it.
1. *Relationship* - Did you improve the relationship? This is the source of power in conversations.
    * Both victim stance and generative stance improve this, because complaining is a fast way to build a relationship.
1. *Self* - Did you bring your best self? Did you help the other person bring their best selves?
    * Victim stance hurts this, generative stance improves it.

## Conflict Management

Effective crisis and conflict management can lead to a stronger relationship than before.

An "honorable complaint" can improve the task, relationship and the self.

* State the breakdown
* Get their story
* State your damage
* Request restitution
* Design how to work better in the future

## Motivation

* "Should" is a doorbell word.

## Change

The key to sustainable change is to follow the path of least resistance. This may require scaling back and building momentum. You need to uncover everyone's hidden commitments (which can be positive or negative).

You need to make a strong connection to your sense of purpose to change ("Values-based adaption"). This is how pregnant women are able to instantly quit smoking.

Fear-based behavior is likely to create the situation you most fear.

1. What was your thought or fear?
1. How did you act when you believed that?
1. How would you act if you didn't believe that?
1. Is there something that could be as true or truer?

### Moments of Choice

Noticing moments of choice is exhausting - it's a "new program to run." It can impact your ability to make other decisions. It can be frustrating, which can reinforce the old behavior.

## Commitments

A commitment is the act of binding yourself to a course of action.

If someone can't say "no", a request is really a command.

## Leadership

Leadership is lifting people's vision, raising their performance, and building their personality-- and then makingn it last in your absence. Leadership is the capacity to shift and focus collective attention. Leadership is the power to co-create the future. Demonstrate your character, competence, influence. You need people to take initiative. Leaders project their shadow or their light. Lack of inner control creates danger. Extroverts and manipulators of the external world sometimes lack internal awareness.

| Myth      | Reality                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Freedom   | Interdependence                     |
| Authority | Needing to build trust              |
| Control   | Commitment                          |
| 1 to 1    | Creating culture                    |
| Ensure a smooth operation | Enhance performance |

| Ineffective leaders lack | Symptom                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Flexibility              | Can't adapt style        |
| Bonding                  | Alienate others          |
| Self-control             | Outbursts                |
| Responsibility           | Defensiveness            |
| Trustworthiness          | Only out for themselves  |
| Social skills            | Arrogant, no empathy     |
| Respect & cooperation    | Try to homogenize groups |

## Integral Theory

|     | Blind Spot | Interior | Exterior |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Individual | Beliefs (filters) | Intention (influences behavior) | Behavior |
| Collective | Beliefs (filters) | Culture (influences intention) | Social Systems (influence intention) |

## Management

Create the conditions for your success. Ask your boss for help. Manage people as if they're volunteers- knowledge workers have lots of mobility. Personal issues aren't the same as private issues.

## Biology

| Part of the brain | Responsible for | Notes |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Reptillian        | Instinct        | Vital functions, pure individuality |
| Limbic (mammalian) | Emotion        | Judgment, importance, interdependence |
| Neocortex         | Thought         |       |

For routine environments, stimuli is process through the Neocortex. Fear and stress bypass the Neocortex and go right for your limbic system (an "Amygdala hijack"). 3 deep breaths is a "circuit breaker" for fear. A thought is a neural firing pattern- a belief is a well-trod pattern. Self-comforting releases oxytocin.

## Emotions

Swallowing a negative emotion concentrates it. Don't invalidate emotions- they aren't right or wrong, they are just happening. Any emotion is the right one given the filter. Challenge the thought, examine the thought, validate the emotion.

Facts ---> Thoughts (Beliefs, could be wrong) ---> Emotions (Never wrong)

Choose to build a new neural pathway. What's another possible reality? Then replace the original thought with the new one.

What's my current story?

* What are the facts (don't change these!)
* What are some alternate realities based on these facts?
* What's one of those that I could believe that would make me feel better?

Choose to have a more positive experience of your life. Your internal voice of judgment is 10:1 negative to positive.

Don't get rid of emotions. They're required for preferences and choice. When emotions turn into negative thoughts instead of action, you enter the lethargy cycle. Negative mindsets come from no concrete reason. You have control over your emotions. Emotions aren't the same thing as opinions. Vulnerability is important, it's what makes you beautiful. You can't selectively numb emotions. 

3 times a day, practice self-compassion (self-kindness, acknowledging your common humanity, and practicing mindfulness [discerning if something is true]). Question what things are doing for your life experience. Walk in and explore your emotions instead of moving away from them. Self-soothe before taking action. Counter a specific negative with a specific positive, and a general negative with a general positive.

### The 8 Basic Emotions

Emotions are your body's calls to action.

| Pain (Loss)     | Call to Action                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Sadness         | Grieve                          |
| Fear            | Protect yourself                |
| Anger           | Reestablish boundaries          |
| Guilt           | Make amends                     |

| Pleasure (Gain) | Call to Action                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Joy             | Celebrate                       |
| Anxiety         | Increase the chances of success |
| Pride           | Self-celebrate                  |
| Gratitude       | Recognize others                |

### Managing Your Emotions

1. Take 3 deep breaths to short-circuit your limbic system and put your neocortex back in control
1. Find the thought, acknowledge the emotion
1. Challenge the thought- is it real?
1. If yes, follow its call to action. If not, clean up your thinking.
