## Harrison XT-DC Drum Character

Used to shape transients in drums. Watch the graph, and set the range for the attack of the drum and the decay of the drum. You can shelf or peak EQ each of them separately to fatten, sharpen, thin, or dull a drum.

## Harrison XT-BC Bass Character

An EQ, but for the character of all notes- not just the notes at those specific frequencies. Set the markers at the fundamental and the harmonics. Great for combining a DI and an amp. Enchance the bark, growl, or bite. Fixes difficiencies or creates artistic effects.
