## Layout Fundamentals

### Absolute measurement systems

* Point system - 1" == 6 picas == 72 points
* Metric

### Relative measurement systems

* Em - Width of M, equal to the size of typeface
* En - Half an em
* Unit - 1000th of an em, used for different sized characters

### Proportional measurement systems

* Golden section
* Fibonacci sequence
* Dynamic rectangles
* Van de Graaf Canon - Optimum proportions for margins and type
* Villard diagram - Different sized text areas
* Renard numbers - 10, 12.5, 16, 20, 25, 31.5, 40, 50, 63, 80
* Rule of thirds - Focal points at intersection, align things with lines
* Le Modulor - Grid based on Fibonacci sequence

## Anatomy of a Grid

### Margins

* Outside of the grid, frame the content
* Symmetrical margins feel static, asymmetric margins feel active
* Narrow side margins reduce tension, wide side margins draw the reader inward
* Be careful about how the content is used (thumb position, etc)

### Columns

* Width of columns is determined by font size
* Need 60-72 characters per line

### Modules

* Modules are the units of space in a grid system
* Too many modules creates visual confusion
* Can be vertical or horizontal
* Proportion may be based on a typical image or paragraph

### Other

Spatial Zones / Field - Groups of modules that make up areas for content
Flowlines / Hanglines - Split the columns into rows
Markers - Placement indicators to help the reader locate important information
Gutter - Inactive area, inside binding or to separate columns of text, or frame content
Alley - Where two pages meet

## Grid Systems

* Grid systems are either symmetrical and static, or asymmetrical and dynamic

### Manuscript Grid

* Single area for text in symmetrical
* Smaller area for secondary content in assymetrical
* Secondary areas in the header and footer
* Wide inner margins

### Symmetrical Grid

* Inner and outer margins are equal
* Single column is good for books and essays, max 60 characters per line
* Multi-column aids in scanning, 40-50 characters per line
* Wider margins == more stability, narrower margins == more tension
* Margins that are wider than the gutters force the eye inward- establish a proportional relationship between them to make that clear

### Modular Grid

* Multi-column grid with multiple flowlines
* Size and proportion of a module can be related to the size of an average paragraph, or of a typical image
* Used in multi-faceted narrative and visual content- Newspapers, event programs, data visualizations and tables, websites
* Combine, or "activate" various modules to create spatial areas

### Asymmetrical Grid

* Where the left and right pages aren't the same, introducing a bias to one side (usually left)
* Smaller margins create tension, which is what biases the eye
* Can be done with columns or modular grids

### Baseline Grid

### Marber Grid

### Hierarchical Grid

### Compound Grid
