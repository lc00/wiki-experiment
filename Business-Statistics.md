## Histogram

Measure of how frequently something occurs.

* What our average turnaround time is

## Pareto Chart

Type of histogram, ranked in order of most frequently occuring to least. Used for defect tracking.

* What are our most frequent errors?
* What caused a project to be late?
* What processes take the longest?

## Weighted Moving Average

Chart that gives the mean over a specific number of values. Takes into account past performance, but weighted toward more recent performance. Used to generate estimates.

* How long will a project take?
* How much will a project cost?
* What is our throughput?

## Box and Whisker Plot

Measures the shape of a distribution.

* How consistent is a process?
* Compare same process over time
* Compare different processes

## Poisson Distribution

Chart that estimates the probability of rare events. Can be used to predict frequency of errors.

* How many resources do we need to dedicate to troubleshooting?
* How many resources do we need to dedicate to change requests?

## Control Chart

Mean, and upper/lower control of +/- 3 sigmas. If something is outside of that, the process is "out of control." Other bad signs are 8+ consecutive above/beow, 10/11, 12/14, trend over 6+, 2/3 are in the outer 1/3, 4/5 are in the outer 2/3s, the centerline shifting from chart to chart.

## Pie Chart

Split of our work

## Things you might measure

* Cost centers, revenue centers, profit centers
* estimates vs. actuals
* How long do we wait / keep people waiting for info?
* New vs. Returning customers
* Close rate

## Process Improvements

* Benchmarking
* JIT
* Reengineering ("Blank Sheet of Paper")
* Map out every process, then Pareto, then Ishikawa
