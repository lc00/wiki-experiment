## Why?

The biggest lever on student learning is great teaching (not technology, curriculum, etc.), and the biggest lever on great teaching is great leadership. Everyone on the team needs to know what the team is trying to do. Instruction and culture are not sequential- you need them both, and they need to developed simultaneously.

Leaders are _instructional_ leaders- not secretaries or contract instructional coaches. They need to live the game.

## Data-Driven Instruction

* It's not whether you taught it, it's whether they learned it

1. *Assessment*: Where is the bar?
    * Assessments should be:
        1. _Interim_: Not just at the end
        1. _Common_ to all classes and students
        1. _Aligned_ to the end goal
    * Standards are meaningless without assessment
    * They set the bar for teachers too
    * Think about what students need to do to pass the assessment
    * Final tests are autopsies, not assessments
    * Use interim assessments, and give yourself enough time to remediate
    * Things like multiple-choice tests are low-resolution, but cheap to score and can give some insight into what interventions are needed
    * You can borrow assessments instead of writing them, but always check for alignment
    * Teaching to the test is only bad if the tests are poorly aligned
1. *Analysis*: Where are students struggling and why?
1. *Action*: Implement new teaching plans
1. *Systems*: Keep changes in place and drive continuous improvement
