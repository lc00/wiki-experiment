## Focus on the wildly important

* From X to Y by when
* Only land one plane at a time
* If everything else stayed the same, what change would have the greatest impact?
* WIGs cascade (policy deployment)
* WIGs are tactics, not strategy

## Act on lead measures

* A good lead measure is predictive and influenceable
* The data is what makes lead measures work
* Lead measures are often the obvious things
* Lead measures are usually more difficult or expensive to measure than the lag measures, but more important

## Keep a compelling score board

* People play differently when they're keeping score
* Always know if you're winning or losing
* A team's scoreboard is different than a player's score board
* Needs to be simple, visible
* Score board is what keeps it from getting lost in the whirlwind

## Create a cadence of accountability

* Accountability is shared
* The whirlwind is not allowed in a WIG meeting
* Report on your commitments, review the scoreboard, clear the path, make new commitments
* Commitments don't need to creative or new
* A commitment must have a specific deliverable- no “focus on”, “work on”
* Actively schedule for your WIG
