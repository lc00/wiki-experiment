* People respond stronger to embracing upsides than avoiding downsides

## Jobs to be done

[Know your customers' jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)

* Companies hire products to solve problems for them. This offers a more fruitful avenue for innovation than trying to find random demographic or psychographic correlations between people.
* A construction company that was trying to sell new units to downsizers realized they were in the business of "moving people's lives" when they realized how emotionally attached families were to their dining room tables. They added space for it, as well as a moving and storage service
* The circumstances around a purchase are more important than customer characteristics, product attributes, new technologies, or trends
* You're often competing against doing nothing at all

### Identifying jobs to be done

* Do you have a job to be done?
* Where do you see non-consumption?
* What work-arounds have people invented?
* What tasks do people want to avoid?
* What surprising uses have customers invented for existing products?

## Putting Products in Services

[Putting Products Into Services](https://hbr.org/2016/09/putting-products-into-services) - HBR

* Professional services firms struggle to get their gross margins above 40%, while product companies regularly do 60%-90%
    * Growing revenue means adding more people, which adds more cost and risk
* By embedding products into services, you automate parts that can be automated, which both drives down prices to competitive levels and allows for elements of non-linear growth
* Customers are still fundamentally buying a service, and little appears different to them
* Evaluate tasks you perform by the frequency and level of sophistication involved. Automate things that are high-volume and low-skill.
* Use ML to make them better over time

Monetization levers away from time:
* Transaction-based pricing: Used when automation allows a higher volume
* Outcome-based pricing: Used when analytics provide better outcomes

Monetization goes from inputs (time), to throughputs (transactions), to outputs (outcomes)
