* Blending is a mindset, not a set of techniques
* When “lecturing”
    * Talk about the standard itself
    * Live demo
    * “Watch the questions I’m asking myself
* Be outcomes-driven, not content-driven
* Data-driven
* Count mastery, not mistakes
* You don’t need to show students the whole plan
* Answer “Why are we doing this?”
