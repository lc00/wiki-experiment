## Color

* When two colors are close in value, the lighter one starts to glow
* Strong value differences create contrast
* Having warm and cool hues creates visual completeness
* Opposites create contrast
* Analagous colors feel more natural

### Categories

* Primary Colors - Red / Yellow / Blue
* Secondary Colors - Orange / Purple /  Green
* Tertiary Colors - Primary + Secondary color
* Analagous Colors - Nearby colors
* Complement - Opposites / Near-Opposites
    * One is cool, other is warm

### Aspects of Color

* Hue
* Value (Shade + Tint) - Amount of black or white mixed with it
* Saturation / Chroma - Purity of color as it blends to gray
    * Colors don't all reach peak saturation at the same place

### Color Models / Color Spaces

Systems for indexing colors

* CMYK - Subtractive, blending, print
    * Overlapping dots, optical color mixing
* RGB - Additive, based on light

## Hierarchy

* Seek to reduce repetition

You can create hierarchy with:

* Weight
* Contrasting color
* Alignment / Indentation
* Spatial grouping / Intervals
* Uppercase / Lowercase
* Scale
* Type style
* Rules
* Depth

## Layers

* You can use layers to create depth
* You can layer typography to tell multiple stories at once
* Overlaying data visualizations
* Time can be a layer
* You can use slits and transparency to glimpse through layers
